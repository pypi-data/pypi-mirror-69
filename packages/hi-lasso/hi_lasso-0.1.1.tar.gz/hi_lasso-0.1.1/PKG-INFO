Description: # Hi-LASSO
        Hi-LASSO(High-Dimensional LASSO) can theoretically improves a LASSO model providing better performance of both prediction and feature selection on extremely 
        high-dimensional data.  Hi-LASSO alleviates bias introduced from bootstrapping, refines importance scores, improves the performance taking advantage of 
        global oracle property, provides a statistical strategy to determine the number of bootstrapping, and allows tests of significance for feature selection with 
        appropriate distribution.  In Hi-LASSO will be applied to Use the pool of the python library to process parallel multiprocessing to reduce the time required for 
        the model.
        
        ## Installation
        **Hi-LASSO** support Python 3.6+, Additionally, you will need ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``tqdm`` and ``glmnet``. 
        However, these packages should be installed automatically when installing this codebase. 
        
        ``Hi-LASSO`` is available through PyPI and can easily be installed with a
        pip install::
        
        ```
        pip install hi_lasso
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        Read the documentation on [readthedocs](https://hi_lasso.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
        
        ## Quick Start
        ```python
        #Data load
        import pandas as pd
        X = pd.read_csv('simulation_data_x.csv')
        y = pd.read_csv('simulation_data_y.csv')
        
        #General Usage
        from hi_lasso.hi_lasso import HiLasso
        
        # Create a HiLasso model
        hi_lasso = HiLasso(X, y)
        
        # Fit the model
        fitted_hi_lasso = hi_lasso.fit()
        
        # Show the coefficients
        fitted_hi_lasso.coef_
        
        # Show the p-values
        fitted_hi_lasso.p_values_
        
        # Show the selected variable
        fitted_hi_lasso.selected_var_
        ```
