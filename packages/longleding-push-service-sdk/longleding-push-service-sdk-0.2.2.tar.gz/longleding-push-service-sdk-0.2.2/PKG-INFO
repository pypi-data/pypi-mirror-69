        # Troubleshoot
        
        If you encounter error messages similar to the following:
        
        ```shell script
        ...
        TypeError: Couldn't build proto file into descriptor pool!
        Invalid proto descriptor for file "common.proto":
          common.proto: A file with this name is already in the pool.
        ```
        
        Setting an environment variable the following before running:
        
        ```shell script
        export PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION='python'
        ```
