# ## Create the pipeline
#
# The example application is based on a pipeline to analyse online news media. It runs using pipemaker but uses minimal, dummy functions for illustration of pipemaker. The real application on which it was based is "compass" which can be installed separately if required.

# example application

# One line of code to create a pipeline from all the functions in the "example" module.

# Configure the job:

# * All files from this run will be under pipedata/sun
# * The web search will be carried out using the domain parameter

env.pipevars.job = "sun"
env.params.domain = "sun.co.uk"

# %% [markdown]
# One line of code shows the upstream pipeline for any task using the current "pipe" variables
#
# * The pipeline has been created automatically linking inputs and outputs.
# * Known parameters and existing files are shown in green.
# * Missing parameters and files are shown in white.
# * When we run a function it will automatically run the upstream pipeline to generate input files
