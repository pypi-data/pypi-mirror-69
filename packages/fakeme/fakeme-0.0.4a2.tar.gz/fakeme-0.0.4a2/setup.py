Define that fields in your datasets must contain similar values\n\n2. You can set up how much values must intersect, for example, you want to emulate data for email validation pipeline - \nyou have one dataset with *incoming* messages  and you need to find all emails that was not added previously in your *contacts* table.\n\nSo you will have incoming messages table, that contains, for example only 70% of emails that exist in contacts table. \n\n3. You can use multiply columns as a key (dependency) in another column, for example, \n*player_final_report* must contains for each player same values as in other tables, for example, you have *player* table\nwith players details and *in_game_player_activity* with all player activities for some test reasons it\'s critical\nto you generate *player_final_report* with 1-to-1 data from other 2 tables.\n \n4. Union tables. You can generate tables that contains all rows from another tables. \n\n5. You can define your own generator for fields on Python.\n\n6. You can define your own output format\n\n\nExamples\n=========================\n\n   You can find usage examples in \'fakeme/examples/\' folder.\n\n    Example from fakeme/examples/generate_data_related_to_existed_files:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from fakeme import Fakeme\n\n    # to use some existed data you should provide with_data argument -\n    # and put inside list with the paths to the file with data\n\n    # data file must be in same format as .json or csv output of fakeme.\n    # so it must be [{"column_name": value, "column_name2": value2 ..},\n    #   {"column_name" : value, "column_name2": value2 ..}..]\n    # Please check example in countries.json\n\n    cities_schema = [{"name": "name"},\n                     {"name": "country_id"},\n                     {"name": "id"}]\n\n    # all fields are strings - so I don\'t define type, because String will be used as default type for the column\n\n    tables_list = [(\'cities\', cities_schema)]\n\n    Fakeme(\n        tables=tables_list,\n        with_data=[\'countries.json\'],\n        rls={\'cities\': {  # this mean: for table \'cities\'\n            \'country_id\': {  # and column \'country_id\' in table \'cities\'\n                \'table\': \'countries.json\',   # please take data from data  in countries.json\n                \'alias\': \'id\',  # with alias name \'id\'\n                \'matches\': 1  # and I want all values in country_id must be from countries.id column, all.\n            }\n        }},\n        settings={\'row_numbers\': 1300}  # we want to have several cities for each country,\n                                        # so we need to have more rows,\n    ).run()\n\n    # run and you will see a list of cities, that generated with same ids as in countries.json\n\n\nDocs: https://fakeme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/',
