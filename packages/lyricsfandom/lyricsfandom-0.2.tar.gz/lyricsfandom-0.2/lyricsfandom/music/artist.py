         That boy, take me away, into the night
        Out of the hum of the street lights and into a forest
        I'll do whatever you say to me in the dark
        Scared I'll be torn apart by a wolf in mask of a familiar name on a birthday card

        Blow out all the candles, blow out all the candles
        "You're too old to be so shy," he says to me so I stay the night
        Just a young heart confusing my mind, but we're both in silence
        Wide-eyed, both in silence
        Wide-eyed, like we're in a crime scene
        etc. ...
