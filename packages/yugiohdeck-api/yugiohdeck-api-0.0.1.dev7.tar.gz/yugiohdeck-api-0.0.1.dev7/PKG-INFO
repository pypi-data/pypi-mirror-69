Description: # About
        
        This is a Python interface to [yugiohdeck.github.io](https://yugiohdeck.github.io/), which turns [the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!_Trading_Card_Game) decks into easily shared links.
        
        This interface allows conversion of decklist links to card data and back. Card data is sourced from [YGOProDeck](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/) and optionally [the YGOrganization DB](https://db.ygorganization.com/).
        
        # Usage
        
        `import yugiohdeck`
        
        `yugiohdeck.ParseURLPasscodes(url)` - Parses a yugiohdeck URL and returns the card passcodes contained
        **_async_** `yugiohdeck.ParseURLData(url)` - Parses a yugiohdeck URL and returns the card passcodes contained + their API data
        `yugiohdeck.GetDeckURL(deck)` - Converts a deck into a yugiohdeck URL; `deck` should be `(name, (main, extra, side))`, same as is returned from the previous methods
