Scripts for use in the IFI Irish Film Archive. Scripts have been tested in OSX/Windows 7/10 and Ubuntu 18.04. The aim is to make cross-platform scripts, but please get in touch with any issues. It is best to download all scripts, as some of them share code.

Most scripts take either a file or a directory as their input, for example makeffv1.py filename.mov or premis.py path/to/folder_of_stuff. (It's best to just drag and drop the folder or filename into the terminal)

NOTE: Objects.py has been copied from https://github.com/simsong/dfxml. walk_to_dfxml.py has also been copied but has been customised in order to add command line arguments for optionally turning off checksum generation. For more context, see https://github.com/simsong/dfxml/pull/28
