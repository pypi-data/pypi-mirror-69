This is a bugfix release for bioinf-helperlibs.

Biopython release 1.77 removed Python 2 support, along
with some 2/3 compatibility logic that we relied on for
our 2/3 compatibility logic.
While release 0.1.12 works around the issue by pinning the
dependencies to an older Biopython version, this version
properly fixes the issue by also dropping Python 2 support
and the compatibility logic going along with that.

Detailed changes:
