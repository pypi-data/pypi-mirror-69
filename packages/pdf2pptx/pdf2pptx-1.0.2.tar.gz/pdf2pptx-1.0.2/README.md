# pdf2pptx

**Utility to convert a PDF slideshow to Powerpoint PPTX.**

Renders each page as a PNG image and creates the resulting Powerpoint 
slideshow from these images. Useful when you want to use Powerpoint 
to present a set of PDF slides (e.g. slides from Beamer). You can then
use the presentation capabilities of Powerpoint (notes, ink on slides,
etc.) with slides created in LaTeX.

I use this to present PDF slides on a Surface Pro so that I can annotate
them with a stylus as I present.

Uses [PyMuPDF](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF) and 
[python-pptx](https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx) to do the hard work.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pdf2pptx
```

## Usage

The following will create a `slides.pptx` file from a `slides.pdf` file.

```bash
pdf2pptx slides.pdf
```

Run `pdf2pptx --help` for more info on the command line interface.
