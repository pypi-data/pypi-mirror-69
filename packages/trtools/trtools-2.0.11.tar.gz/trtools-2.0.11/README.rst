TRTools
============

TRTools includes a variety of utilities for filtering, quality control and analysis of short tandem repeats (STRs) and variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) downstream of genotyping them from next-generation sequencing. It supports multiple recent genotyping tools (see below).

See full documentation and examples at https://trtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Install
-------

You can obtain TRTools from pip::

        pip install --upgrade pip
	pip install trtools

(Note: trtools installation may fail for pip version 10.0.1, hence the need to upgrade pip first)

Or, to install from source, run the following command from the base directory of the TRTools repo::

	python setup.py install [--prefix=PREFIX]

to install locally, set :code:`--prefix=$HOME` and ensure :code:`$HOME` is on your :code:`PYTHONPATH`.

(Note, required package :code:`pybedtools` requires zlib. If you receive an error about a missing file :code:`zlib.h`, you can install on Ubuntu using :code:`sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev` or CentOS using :code:`sudo yum install zlib-devel`.)

Tools
-----
TRTools includes the following tools.

* dumpSTR: a tool for filtering VCF files with STR/VNTR genotypes
* mergeSTR: a tool to merge VCF files across multiple samples genotyped using the same tool
* statSTR: a tool for computing various statistics on VCF files
* compareSTR: a tool for comparing TR callsets
* qcSTR: a tool for generating various quality control plots for a TR callset

Type :code:`<command> --help` to see a full set of options.

It additionally includes a python library, :code:`trtools`, which can be accessed from within Python scripts. e.g.::

	import trtools.utils.utils as stls
	allele_freqs = {5: 0.5, 6: 0.5} # 50% of alleles have 5 repeat copies, 50% have 6
	stls.GetHeterozygosity(allele_freqs) # should return 0.5

Usage
-----

See the README in each subdirectory for usage details.

Contributing
------------

We appreciate contributions to TRTools. If you would like to contribute a fix or new feature, follow these guidelines:

* Consider `discussing <https://github.com/gymreklab/TRTools/issues>`_ your solution with us first so we can provide help or feedback if necessary.
* Fork the repository.
* Install it into a clean environment
* Additionally, install `pytest` in your environment.
* Make your changes. 
* Ensure all functions, modules, classes etc. conform to Numpy docstring standards (https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).
* Add tests (see :code:`tests/` folder to find the appropriate location for new tests) to test any new functionality. To make sure pytest knows about them, you may need to edit :code:`pytest.ini`.
* Run :code:`pytest --cov=. --cov-report term-missing` to make sure that (1) all tests pass and (2) any code you have added is covered by tests.
* If applicable, update REAMDEs with new usage information.
* Submit a pull request, with a reasonably descriptive message of what changes you have made.
