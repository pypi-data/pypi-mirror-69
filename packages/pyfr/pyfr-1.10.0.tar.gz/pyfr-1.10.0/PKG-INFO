Description: PyFR is an open-source Python based framework for
        solving advection-diffusion type problems on streaming architectures
        using the Flux Reconstruction approach of Huynh. The framework is
        designed to solve a range of governing systems on mixed unstructured
        grids containing various element types. It is also designed to target a
        range of hardware platforms via use of an in-built domain specific
        language derived from the Mako templating engine.
