Description: # Elcano
        
        **Currently under initial development, do not use.**
        
        This Python 3 library is a visual dataset explorer that can be used to analyse the main properties of a dataset. It is named after [Juan Sebastián Elcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Sebasti%C3%A1n_Elcano), the explorer who completed the first circumnavigation of the Earth.
        
        Some of the main features of this library are:
        
        * Wide format support: The formats ARFF, BSI, CSV, DAT, DATA, JSON, LIBSVM, M, NAMES, XRFF and their gzipped versions can be used.
        * Comprehensive analysis features: many analysis tools are available to study the dataset, giving access to well-known toolboxes such as scikit-learn, keras and pandas.
        * Pipeline storage and sharing: the pipelines created can be saved locally and uploaded to the pipeline cloud.
        * Simple-yet-powerful interface: when a dataset is loaded, a web platform is deployed locally to analyse the datasets visually. Every pipeline can be exported as a script to avoid losing the grip on the process.
        
        ## Install and usage
        
        Installing and using this library is as simple as:
        
        ```shell
        $ pip install elcano
        Successfully installed elcano-0.1
        $ elcano dataset.csv
        ```
        
        A complete reference will be added as the development of this library advances.
