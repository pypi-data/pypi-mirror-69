# Itarj Console

Itarj Console is a CLI application created with python. This application is aimed at reducing the rate at which internet users fall for job scams. Users of the application can be able to search the database for Job openings that have been flagged as **scams**.

## Features

Itarj Console provides the following features:

* Beautiful User interface:

  We know that console applications can look plain sometimes. So we decided to spice it up with some colour
* Users can create posts, these posts will be uploaded to the database and other users will be able to see it.
* Users can also search the database for posts using keyword, and the results will be automatically returned through a website on the browser.
