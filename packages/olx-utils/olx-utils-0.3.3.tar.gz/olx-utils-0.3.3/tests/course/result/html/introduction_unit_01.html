<p>Learning is the process of acquiring new, or modifying existing,
knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, or preferences. The ability
to learn is possessed by humans, animals, and some machines; there is
also evidence for some kind of learning in some plants. Some
learning is immediate, induced by a single event (e.g. being burned by
a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge accumulates from repeated
experiences. The changes induced by learning often last a lifetime,
and it is hard to distinguish learned material that seems to be "lost"
from that which cannot be retrieved.</p>
