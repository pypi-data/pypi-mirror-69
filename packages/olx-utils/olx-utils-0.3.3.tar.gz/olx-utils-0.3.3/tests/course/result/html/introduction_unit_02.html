<p>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a
set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both
human-readable and machine-readable. The W3C's XML 1.0
Specification and several other related specifications—all of
them free open standards—define XML.</p>

<p>The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and
usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with
strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the
design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for
the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used
in web services.</p>

<p>Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based
languages, while programmers have developed many application
programming interfaces (APIs) to aid the processing of XML data.</p>
