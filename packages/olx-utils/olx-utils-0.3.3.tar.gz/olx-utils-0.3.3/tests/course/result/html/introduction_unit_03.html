<p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming
language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability,
notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that
enable clear programming on both small and large scales. Van Rossum
led the language community until stepping down as leader in July 2018.</p>

<p>Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory
management. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural, and has a
large and comprehensive standard library.</p>

<p>Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. CPython,
the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and
has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of Python's
other implementations. Python and CPython are managed by the
non-profit Python Software Foundation.</p>
