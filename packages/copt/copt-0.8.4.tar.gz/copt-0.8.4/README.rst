copt: composite optimization in Python
=======================================

copt is an optimization library for Python. Its goal is to provide a high quality implementation of classical optimization algorithms under a consistent API. 



`Docs <http://openopt.github.io/copt/>`_ | `Examples <http://openopt.github.io/copt/auto_examples/index.html>`_




Installation
============

If you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy,
the easiest way to install copt is using ``pip`` ::

    pip install -U copt


Alternatively, you can install the latest development from github with the command::

    pip install git+https://github.com/openopt/copt.git


Citing
======

If this software is useful for your research, please consider citing it as

.. code::

    @article{copt,
      author       = {Fabian Pedregosa, Geoffrey Negiar, Gideon Dresdner},
      title        = {copt: composite optimization in Python},
      year         = 2020,
      DOI          = {10.5281/zenodo.1283339},
      url={http://openopt.github.io/copt/}
    }

Development
===========

The recommended way to work on the development versionis the following:

1. Clone locally the github repo. This can be done with the command::

    git clone https://github.com/openopt/copt.git

This will create a copt directory.

2. Link this directory to your Python interpreter. This can be done by
running the following command from the copt directory created with the
previous step::

    python setup.py develop

Now you can run the tests with :code:`py.test tests/`
