        Social Rest API
        ===============
        
        Social Rest API is a Django app to conduct construction of APIs ment to be used for on-demannd and social apps.
        
        Detailed documentation is in the "docs" directory.
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. This app is using `django-rest-framework` to provide API endpoints, which means this app will need to be added to the list of installed apps.
        The app will automatically install `django-rest-framework` if it's not installed.
        `on_demand` also needs to be added to the list of installed apps::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'on_demand',
                'rest_framework'
            ]
        
        2. Include the Django On Demand URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
            path('ondemand/', include('on_demand.urls')),
        
        3. Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to create the Social Rest API models.
        
        4. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
           to create an Social API (you'll need the Admin app enabled).
        
        5. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ondemand/ to test the new API.
