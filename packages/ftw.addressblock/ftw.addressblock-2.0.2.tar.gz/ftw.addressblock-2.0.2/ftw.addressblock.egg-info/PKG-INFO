        ################
        
        **IMPORTANT:** In Plone 5 a plonetheme other than the default has to be installed for some
        things to work (i.e. plonetheme.blueberry).
        
        **IMPORTANT:** If the geo profile is enabled a special workflow has to be followed
        in order to use custom map extracts.
        - Add an address in the address tab and save.
        - Edit again and now the map extraction can be edited.
        
        This package is an addon for `ftw.simplelayout <http://github.com/4teamwork/ftw.simplelayout>`_. Please make sure you
        already installed ``ftw.simplelayout`` on your plone site before installing this addon.
        
        This add-on installs a new content type which can be used to display address data.
        
        Extras
        ======
        
        There is an extra ``geo`` which installs optional geo and map support. If you
        want to use this feature you must install ``geo`` profile in your policy.
        
        Since ``1.2.1`` the zoomlevel and maplayer defined in the addressblocks edit panel
        is saved. However, this will only work together with ``ftw.simplelayout`` versions
        ``2.1.0`` and ``1.23.10`` (backport) or higher. For more information see
        `ftw.simplelayout#530 <https://github.com/4teamwork/ftw.simplelayout/pull/530>`_
        and `ftw.addressblock#25 <https://github.com/4teamwork/ftw.addressblock/pull/25>`_.
        
        There is an extra ``contact`` which will provide a contact form. If you
        want to use this feature you must install both the ``default`` and the ``contact``
        profile in your policy (the  ``contact`` profile won't install the  ``default``
        profile).
        
        The contact form provides a ReCaptcha field which is only rendered for anonymous
        users.
