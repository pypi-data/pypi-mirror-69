**IMPORTANT:** In Plone 5 a plonetheme other than the default has to be installed for some
things to work (i.e. plonetheme.blueberry).

**IMPORTANT:** If the geo profile is enabled a special workflow has to be followed
in order to use custom map extracts.
- Add an address in the address tab and save.
- Edit again and now the map extraction can be edited.

This package is an addon for `ftw.simplelayout <http://github.com/4teamwork/ftw.simplelayout>`_. Please make sure you
already installed ``ftw.simplelayout`` on your plone site before installing this addon.

This add-on installs a new content type which can be used to display address data.

Extras
======

There is an extra ``geo`` which installs optional geo and map support. If you
want to use this feature you must install ``geo`` profile in your policy.

Since ``1.2.1`` the zoomlevel and maplayer defined in the addressblocks edit panel
is saved. However, this will only work together with ``ftw.simplelayout`` versions
``2.1.0`` and ``1.23.10`` (backport) or higher. For more information see
`ftw.simplelayout#530 <https://github.com/4teamwork/ftw.simplelayout/pull/530>`_
and `ftw.addressblock#25 <https://github.com/4teamwork/ftw.addressblock/pull/25>`_.

There is an extra ``contact`` which will provide a contact form. If you
want to use this feature you must install both the ``default`` and the ``contact``
profile in your policy (the  ``contact`` profile won't install the  ``default``
profile).

The contact form provides a ReCaptcha field which is only rendered for anonymous
users.
