Description: git-remote-cvm
        =====================
        
        This package provides a simple method for pushing and pulling from `AWS
        CodeCommit <https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/>`__ using the CVM. This package extends `git
        <https://git-scm.com/>`__ to support repository URLs prefixed with
        **cvm://**.
        
        ... you can clone repositories as simply as...
        
        ::
        
          % git clone cvm://role-name@account-name/repository-name
        
        The *git-remote-cvm* package works on Python versions:
        
        * 3.6.x and greater
        * 3.7.x and greater
        
        Prerequisites
        =============
        
        Before you can use *git-remote-cvm*, you must:
        
        * Complete initial configuration for AWS CodeCommit, including:
        
          * Install and configure the CVM
        
        * Create an AWS CodeCommit repository (or have one already) in your AWS account.
        * Install Python and its package manager, pip, if they are not already installed. To download and install the latest version of Python, `visit the Python website <https://www.python.org/>`__.
        * Install Git on your Linux, macOS, Windows, or Unix computer.
        * Install the latest version of the AWS CLI on your Linux, macOS, Windows, or Unix computer. You can find instructions `here <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html>`__.
        
        Note: Installation of the AWS CLI on some operating systems requires pip version 9.0.3 or later. To check your version of pip, open a terminal and type the following command:
        
        ::
        
          % pip --version
        
        If the version is not 9.0.3 or later, run the following commands to update your version of pip:
        
        ::
        
          % curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
          % python3 get-pip.py --user
        
        Set Up

        Step 1: Install git-remote-cvm
        -------------------------------------
        
        * On your Linux, macOS, Windows, or Unix computer, install *git-remote-cvm* using the `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__ command. For example:
        
        ::
        
          % pip3 install git-remote-cvm
        
        * If you already have *git-remote-cvm* installed you can upgrade to the latest version with the **--upgrade** parameter:
        
        ::
        
          % pip3 install --upgrade git-remote-cvm
        
        Step 4: Clone your repository
        -----------------------------
        
        * At the terminal, run the **git clone cvm** command, using the details of your repository. For example:
        
        ::
        
          % git clone cvm://power-user-role@dev-account/web-project-1
          Cloning into 'web-project-1'...
