Description: # Chess-Cheat

        Launch Chess-Cheat, open your favourite chess website and the tool will dinamically overlay the best move for you.
        
        ![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GabrieleMaurina/chess-cheat/master/images/example.png)
        
        ### Install
        
        To successfully run Chess-Cheat first clone this repository with:
        
        `git clone https://github.com/GabrieleMaurina/chess-cheat.git`
        
        Then install the following dependencies:
        * [Python 3](https://www.python.org/ "Python website")
        * [Tensorflow](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/ "Tensorflow for python")
        * [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/ "Stockfish website") installed in your system
        * [Stockfish](https://pypi.org/project/stockfish/ "Stockfish for python") for python
        * [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/ "Pillow for python")
        * [Pyscreenshot](https://pypi.org/project/pyscreenshot/ "Pyscreenshot for python")
        * [Timeout decorator](https://pypi.org/project/timeout-decorator/ "Timeout decorator for python")
        
        ### Usage
        
        Once you have all the dependencies installed, launch `chess-cheat.py` as follows:
        
        `python chess-cheat.py`
        
        ### How it works
        
        Chess-Cheat is based on [Tensorflow_Chessbot](https://github.com/Elucidation/tensorflow_chessbot "Tensorflow_Chessbot github") for recognizing the chessboard on your screen.
        
        It uses [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/ "Stockfish website") to compute the best move.
        
        It displays the arrows and the buttons on the screen with [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html "Tkinter documentation").
