This codebase enables identifying the relevant network connections between a set of query nodes.
The method is designed to operate on hetnets (networks with multiple node or relationship types).

This project is still under development.
Use with caution.

## Environment

Install via pip from GitHub using:

```shell
# install the latest release from PyPI
pip install hetmatpy

# install latest version on GitHub
pip install git+https://github.com/hetio/hetmatpy

# for local development, run the following inside the development environment:
pip install --editable .
```
