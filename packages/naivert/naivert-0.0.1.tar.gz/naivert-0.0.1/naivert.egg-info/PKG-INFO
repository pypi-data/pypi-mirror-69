Description: # naivert
        
        naivert is an pure Python implementation of ray tracing algorithm using Phong illumination model.  
        For geometry calculation, naivert uses the library of [Geometry3D](https://github.com/GouMinghao/Geometry3D).
        Basic materials and light sources are given in the configuration file. You can also define the material and light source by yourself.
        You may refer to the examples and documentation of Geometry3D to get to know how to use naivert.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        numpy, Geometry3D, matplotlib and opencv-python
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install naivert
        ```
        
        ## Examples
        Run .py files under examples folder.  
        For example:
        ```bash
        python example3.py
        ```
        ![sample3](sample3.png)
        
        ```bash
        python example4.py
        ```
        ![sample3](sample4.png)
        
        ```bash
        python example5.py
        ```
        ![sample3](sample5.png)
        
        Note that the calculation may be very slow. You can modify the resolution of the image to reduce the time cost.
