# Docs

These docs are built using [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and [typer-cli](https://typer.tiangolo.com/typer-cli/).

Edit the docs locally by running `make serve-docs`, and opening `localhost:8000` in a browser. Mkdocs will update the local version on the fly, as you edit.

Build a static version of the site using `make build-docs`. This will be stored in `/site`.
