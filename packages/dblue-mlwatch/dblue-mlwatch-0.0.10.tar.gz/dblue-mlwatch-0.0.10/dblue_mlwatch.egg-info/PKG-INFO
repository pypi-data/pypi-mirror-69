        ```bash
        # Jump to the correct folder
        cd /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs
        
        # Move the new SDK out of the way
        sudo mv MacOSX10.15.sdk MacOSX10.15.sdk.1
        
        # Link the newer SDK to the old one
        sudo ln -s MacOSX10.14.sdk MacOSX10.15.sdk
        
        # Install psutil or the package which depends on it
        pip install -U psutil
        
        # Remove the temporary symlink we made in step 3
        sudo rm MacOSX10.15.sdk
        
        # Restore to the former state
        sudo mv MacOSX10.15.sdk.1 MacOSX10.15.sdk
        ```
