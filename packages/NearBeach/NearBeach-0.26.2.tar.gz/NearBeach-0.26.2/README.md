NearBeach is currently in beta development. If you find any issues, or require any help, please do not hesitate to contact on our forums. https://help.nearbeach.org

## What is NearBeach?
NearBeach is a project and task management tool (PATMT) with a basic customer relationship management tool to help you manage your projects and task. The phillosophy of NearBeach is to be easy to install and use, be open sourced, be flexible, and aimed at small/personal organisation to large enterprises. Each new module brought to NearBeach expands it's capability tenfold and brings it closer to a competing product.

## Features
NearBeach's main focus is to create both projects and task. Each task can then be assigned to as many projects required (sometimes multiple projects will need to have the same task completed). Each project and task can also be assigned to multiple users to complete.

However projects and task are but a small feature to a PATMT system. You will need to store user requirement and be able to assign those requirement items to projects/task for completion. You will need to track these requirement to make sure they are completed. NearBeach has recently implemented a requirement module to help you store all your customer's requirement

What if you have an opportunity? You do not have the user's full requirement yet, but there could easily be a sale involved. NearBeach has also implemented the opportunity module, to help you store each potential opportunity that comes through the pipeline.

Finally, you might need to send a quote to your customer. As a new feature, the Quotes module has been implemented into NearBeach.
