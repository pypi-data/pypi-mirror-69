Description: # Blender Notebook
        
        A simple command line tool to wrap blender 2.8+ as a jupyter kernel.
        
        Blender's python API requires its embedded python interpreter. As of Blender 2.82, python 3.7 is packaged. In order to make ipykernel and other pip packages accessible to Blender, the `site-packages` directory of the python interpreter executing blender_notebook will be added to Blender's python path. Therefore, it's highly recommended to use exactly the same python version as your blender.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The easiest way to install blender_notebook is via pip:
        ```
        $ python -m pip install blender_notebook
        ```
        
        It can also be installed from source:
        ```
        $ python -m pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        If blender in installed by a package manager, the easiest way to find the executable path is:
        ```
        $ which blender
        /snap/bin/blender
        ```
        In my case, blender is installed from snap.
        
        On MacOS, the blender executable path is usually:
        ```
        /Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender
        ```
        
        On Windows, the blender executable path is usually:
        ```
        C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 2.82\blender.exe
        ```
        
        Then, run the blender_notebook CLI (replace `"snap/bin/blender"` with your blender executable path):
        ```
        $ blender_notebook install --blender-exec="/snap/bin/blender"
        Saving files to ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/blender
        ```
        If you launch jupyter notebook as usual, a new kernel named `blender` should be available.
        ```
        $ jupyter kernelspec list
        Available kernels:
        blender              ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/blender
        
        $ jupyter notebook
        ```
        
        You can also delete the kernel:
        ```
        $ blender_notebook remove
        Are you sure to delete ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/blender ? [y/N]: y
        blender jupyter kernel is removed!
        ```
