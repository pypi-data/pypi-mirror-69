# pyzwave

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/pyzwave/pyzwave/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/pyzwave/pyzwave?branch=master)
[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyzwave/badge/?version=latest)](https://pyzwave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

**[pyzwave](https://github.com/pyzwave/pyzwave)** is **[Z-Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Wave)** library to implement the **[Z-Wave](https://www.z-wave.com/)** standard as a Python 3 library.

**[pyzwave](https://github.com/pyzwave/pyzwave)** is inspired by **[zigpy](https://github.com/zigpy/zigpy)**.

## Compatible hardware

pyzwave uses **[Z/IP Gateway](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/z-wave/controller-sdk/z-ip-gateway-sdk)** to talk with the hardware. Any hardware working with Z/IP Gateway should work with pyzwave. Z/IP Gateway requires the Z-Wave chip to be running the bridge firmware which unfortunately not all adapters do.

pyzwave could be adapted to talk directly with a non bridge controller but due to a signed NDA the source for this cannot be open sourced by **[Telldus Technologies AB](https://telldus.com)** (the author behind this library).

## Status

**[Z/IP Gateway](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/z-wave/controller-sdk/z-ip-gateway-sdk)** requires the connection between this library to be encrypted using DTLS. This library includes a connection using DTLS but unfortunately unsolicited reports does not yet work using this.

A workaround until this issue is resolved is to recompile Z/IP gateway to not use DTLS for the connection. Any help getting the DTLS fully supported is welcome.

## Documentation

## Release packages available via PyPI

Packages of tagged versions are also released via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/python-zwave/)
