    """Factory for creating dmabuf-based wl_buffers

    Following the interfaces from:
    https://www.khronos.org/registry/egl/extensions/EXT/EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import.txt
    https://www.khronos.org/registry/EGL/extensions/EXT/EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import_modifiers.txt
    and the Linux DRM sub-system's AddFb2 ioctl.

    This interface offers ways to create generic dmabuf-based wl_buffers.
    Immediately after a client binds to this interface, the set of supported
    formats and format modifiers is sent with 'format' and 'modifier' events.

    The following are required from clients:

    - Clients must ensure that either all data in the dma-buf is coherent for
      all subsequent read access or that coherency is correctly handled by the
      underlying kernel-side dma-buf implementation.

    - Don't make any more attachments after sending the buffer to the
      compositor. Making more attachments later increases the risk of the
      compositor not being able to use (re-import) an existing dmabuf-based
      :class:`~pywayland.protocol.wayland.WlBuffer`.

    The underlying graphics stack must ensure the following:

    - The dmabuf file descriptors relayed to the server will stay valid for the
      whole lifetime of the :class:`~pywayland.protocol.wayland.WlBuffer`. This
      means the server may at any time use those fds to import the dmabuf into
      any kernel sub-system that might accept it.

    To create a :class:`~pywayland.protocol.wayland.WlBuffer` from one or more
    dmabufs, a client creates a zwp_linux_dmabuf_params_v1 object with a
    :func:`ZwpLinuxDmabufV1.create_params()` request. All planes required by
    the intended format are added with the 'add' request. Finally, a 'create'
    or 'create_immed' request is issued, which has the following outcome
    depending on the import success.

    The 'create' request, - on success, triggers a 'created' event which
    provides the final   :class:`~pywayland.protocol.wayland.WlBuffer` to the
    client. - on failure, triggers a 'failed' event to convey that the server
    cannot use the dmabufs received from the client.

    For the 'create_immed' request, - on success, the server immediately
    imports the added dmabufs to   create a
    :class:`~pywayland.protocol.wayland.WlBuffer`. No event is sent from the
    server in this case. - on failure, the server can choose to either:   -
    terminate the client by raising a fatal error.   - mark the
    :class:`~pywayland.protocol.wayland.WlBuffer` as failed, and send a
    'failed' event to the     client. If the client uses a failed
    :class:`~pywayland.protocol.wayland.WlBuffer` as an argument to any
    request, the behaviour is compositor implementation-defined.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and backward
    incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes may be added
    together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward
    incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in the protocol
    and interface names and resetting the interface version. Once the protocol
    is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the version number in the
    protocol and interface names are removed and the interface version number
    is reset.
