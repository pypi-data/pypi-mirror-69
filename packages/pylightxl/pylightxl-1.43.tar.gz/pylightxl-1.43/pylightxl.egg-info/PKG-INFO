        # pylightxl - A Light Weight Excel Reader/Writer
        A light weight, zero dependency (only standard libs used), to the point (no bells and whistles) 
        Microsoft Excel reader/writer python 2.7-3+ library. See documentation: [docs](https://pylightxl.readthedocs.io)
        
        Sample - see [docs - quick start guide](https://pylightxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) for more examples:

        #### **Supports**:
         - Reader supports .xlsx and .xlsm file extensions.
         - Writer only supports .xlsx (no macros/buttons/graphs/formatting) 
        
        #### **Limitations**:
         - Does not support .xls (excel 97-2003 worksheet).
         - Does not support worksheet cell data more than 536,870,912 cells (32-bit list limitation).
         - Writer does not support anything other than writing values/formulas/strings.
         - Writing to existing workbooks will remove any macros/buttons/graphs/formatting!
        
        #### **In-work version 1.5**
        - additional database indexing features
        - performance
        
        #### **pypi version 1.42**
        - added support for pathlib file reading
        - bug fix: previous version did not handle merged cells properly
        - bug fix: database updates did not update maxcol maxrow if new data addition was larger than the initial
          dataset
        - bug fix: writexl that use linefeeds did not read in properly into readxl (fixed regex)
        - bug fix: writexl filepath issues
        
        
        #### **Why pylightxl over pandas/openpyxl**
        - **(compatibility +1, small lib +1)** pylightxl has no external dependencies (only uses python built-in 
          standard libs).
        - **(compatibility +1)** pylightxl was written to be compatible for python 2.7-3+ under one single
          pylightxl version. It does not impose rules on users to switch versions.
        - **(small lib +1)** pylightxl was written to simply read/write, thereby making the library small 
          without any bells or whistles which makes it easy to compile with PyInstaller and other packagers
        - **(user friendly +1)** pylightxl was written to be as pythonic and easy to use as possible. Core 
          developers actively survey Stack Overflow questions on working with excel files to tailor the API 
          for most common problems.
        - **(see [xlrd](https://xlrd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) before pylightxl)** Note that the xlrd library is 
          very similar in values to pylightxl, but with much more functionality! Please take a look 
          at [xlrd](https://xlrd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to see if it is a good fit for your project.
          So why pick pylightxl over xlrd that has much more to offer? Currently, xlrd does not have any active
          developers. Pylightxl is a new library aimed to help solve current excel data issues (as surveyed 
          by Stack Overflow), please submit your suggestions to help improve this library together.

        #### **Setup**
        pylightxl is officially published on [pypi.org](pypi.org), however one of the
        key features of pylightxl is that it is packed light in case the user has pip
        and/or download restrictions, see [docs - installation](https://pylightxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
        
        ```pip install pylightxl```
