    This script will cause the page to reload whenever it's "stale".

    A page is considered stale if the user has posted any form in the same browser session after the page was initially rendered.

    Staleness is checked at:
        page load (in case the page was loaded from html cache)
        pageshow (in case the page was loaded from in-memory 'bf' cache)
        visibilitychange (in case you opened a form in a new tab, and returned to this tab)
        window focus (in case you opened a form in a new window, and came back to this window)
