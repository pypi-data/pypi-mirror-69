## 3.0.4

Deprecated a number of form-related features:
- js_response.py
- ajax_all_forms.js
- set_form_errors.js

We recommend installing and using django_jsform instead. Note, however, that set_form_errors.js may still be useful, and we _may_ want to move that functionality to jsform.

## 3.0.3
qnc-popup - added ability to open on hover

## 3.0.2

qnc-popup bug fixes

## 3.0.1

Changed login behaviour: replace history entry (of the login form) rather than creating a new one.
This is really how it should have worked all along.

# 3.0.0

Breaking changes:

Renamed the following data-* attributes to qnc-* (from utils.js):
    - qnc-link
    - qnc-replace-location
    - qnc-confirm-first
    - qnc-add-row-to-formset
    - qnc-formset-template
    - qnc-formset-container
    - qnc-ajax-submit-on-change

In your templates, you should be able to replace: 
    data-(link|replace-location|ajax-submit-on-change|formset-container|formset-template|add-row-to-formset|confirm-first)
With:
    qnc-$1
