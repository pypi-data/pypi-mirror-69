Description: # binfilepy
        
        Software library to read and write binary file (.adibin format).
        
        ## Example to write a binary file:
        ```
        from binfilepy import BinFile
        from binfilepy import CFWBINARY
        from binfilepy import CFWBCHANNEL
        
        with BinFile(filename, "w") as f:
            header = CFWBINARY()
            header.setValue(1.0 / 240.0, 2019, 1, 28, 8, 30, 0.0, 0.0, 2, 0)
            f.setHeader(header)
            channel1 = CFWBCHANNEL()
            channel1.setValue("I", "mmHg", 1.0, 0.0)
            f.addChannel(channel1)
            channel2 = CFWBCHANNEL("II", "mmHg", 1.0, 0.0)
            f.addChannel(channel2)
            chanData = []
            d1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
            d2 = [8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
            chanData.append(data1)
            chanData.append(data2)
            f.writeHeader()
            f.writeChannelData(chanData)
            f.updateSamplesPerChannel(16, True)
        ```
        
        ## Example to read a binary file:
        ```
        from binfilepy import BinFile
        
        with BinFile(filename, "r") as f:
            # You must read header first before you can read channel data
            f.readHeader()
            # readChannelData() supports reading in random location (Ex: Read 10 secs of data at 1 min mark)
            data = f.readChannelData(offset=60, length=10, useSecForOffset=True, useSecForLength=True)
        ```
        
        ## File open mode
        Currently, there are three modes to open a file:
        - "w": For writing to a new file.  You need to make sure the file doesn't exist.
        - "r": For reading from an existing file.  You need to make sure the file exists.
        - "r+": For appending data to an existing file.  You need to make sure the file exists.
        
        You can use either syntax:
        ```
        with BinFile(filename, "w") as f:
            ...
            ...
        ```
        or
        ```
        f = BinFile(filename, "w")
        f.open()
        ...
        ...
        f.close()
        ```
