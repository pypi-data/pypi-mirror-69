        [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/circleci-docs.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/circleci-docs)
        
        A Python based CLI that works with [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store] in the simplest way possible.
        Powered by [Boto3] & [Click]!
        
        ## Main Features
        - Simple, intuitive and easy to use CLI to use as password managemant tool!
        - Levraging AWS password managemant capabilities and without cost! Free of charge!
        - Quick installation & lightweight
        - Duality - Allows using both as CLI for developer to utilize and as also as a Python client to run in CI
        - Hight test coverage for a reltively simple CLI
        
        > The ssm-simple-cli is designated to act primarily as a CLI but it also allows using it as a Python client.
        > Most of the instructions below will help you setup & use the ssm-simple-cli as a plain CLI.
        > If you are interested in using it as a client within Python code you can read more in the [Development](##development) section. 
        
        ## Installation
        ### Please make sure:
        - You have Python 3 version installed.
        - You are NOT on any virtualenv
        - You have configured AWS credentials with the neccessary user profile permissions. See [AWS Permissions section](#aws-permissions--credentials) for more information.
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install --editable .
        ```
        ## Initial Setup
        
        > Since ssm-simple-cli uses [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store] behind the scenes, you must have a valid AWS account with crednetials set up. See [AWS Permissions section](#aws-permissions--credentials) for more info.
        
        After a fresh install, you will have to configure you cli for the first time:
        
        ```sh
        $ ssm configure
        ```
        
        This will require you to enter you AWS account credentials. You can also configure the ssm-simple-cli to point to a specific named AWS profile:
        
        ```sh
        $ ssm configure -p <my-desired-aws-profile-name>
        ```
        
        > To read more about multiple AWS profiles support [click here](#####multiple-aws-profile-support!).
        
        ## Usage
        
        Once ssm-siple-cli was configure, simply type `ssm` in you desired shell to show the main help menu:
        
        ```console
        $ ssm
        
        Usage: ssm [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
        
        Options:
          --help  Show this message and exit.
        
        Commands:
          configure  Setup an initial configuration for this cli
          describe   Retrieve a list of available secrets
          get        Retrieve a specific secret.
          put        Submit a new secret to the SSM store
        ```
        
        You can also use the `--help` flag on a specific command to find our more about it and its parameters:
        
        ```sh
        $ ssm describe --help
        
        Usage: ssm describe [OPTIONS]
        
          Retrieve a list of available secrets
        
        Options:
          -c, --copy       Copies the selected secret value to your clipboard
          -g, --get        Give you a prompt to choose which secret to get
          -p, --path TEXT  Describe only parameters located in a specific path (must start with "/")
        
          --help           Show this message and exit.
        
        ```
        
        ## AWS permissions & credentials 
        
        In order to run the ssm-simple-cli you must have a valid AWS account, AWS credentials and basic permissions to the [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store]. Please read below in order to get more details.
        
        ### AWS Account
        Just go to the [AWS homepage](https://aws.amazon.com/) and create an account. No initial sum requied!
        
        ### Credentials
        
        AWS credentials are usually configured using the [aws-cli]. you should install the cli and then configure your AWS credentials using this command:
        
        ```sh
        $ aws configure
        ```
        
        [Click here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html#cli-quick-configuration-creds) for more information on how to obtain such credentials
        
        Once you have these credentials in place you will be able to [setup](##initial-setup) the ssm-simple-cli.
        
        ##### Multiple AWS Profile Support!
        When you setup the [aws-cli], credentials are stored in a default AWS profile however if you use multiple [named AWS profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html) the ssm-simple-cli totally supports this!
        
        > By default the ssm-simple-cli uses the "default" AWS profile
        
        To view what current AWS profile I'm using simply run
        
        ```sh
        $ ssm configure -s
        ```
        
        This will print the curent AWS named profile the ssm-simple-cli is using.
        
        If you wish to configure a different named AWS profile:
        
        ```sh
        $ ssm configure -p <my-desired-aws-profile-name>
        ```
        
        This will direct the ssm-simple-cli to use crednetials for this specific named AWS profile
        
        ### Permissions
        
        Your user must have the proper permissions in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. See [this example](example/aws/policy/README.md) in this repo for more information.
        
        
        ## Development
        
        ### Running within Python code
        > Can be run in CI!
        
        The ssm-simple-cli also allows running the actual commands within Python code. This provides a more holistic use of the same password mangemant tool & code in both the developer terminal & the actual CI build. Highly recommended!
        
        To import the Python client code simply import the following classes:
        ```python
        from cli.src.ssm_cli import CliConfiguration
        from cli.src.ssm_client import SSMClient
        ```
        
        To initialize the client simply configure a `CLIConfiguration` and provide it to the client
        
        ```python
         # by default the ssm-simple-cli configuration file sits at '~/.ssm/config' but can be anywhere
        config = CliConfiguration('<configuration-file-path>')
        client = SSMClient(config)
        ```
        
        ### Testing
        
        ssm-simple-cli utilizes [PyTest], [PyTest Fixtures] and [Moto] to run Unit + Integration Tests.
        
        To run the tests simply type the following in main folder:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        $ pytest
        
        ```
        
        ### Todos
        
         - Add MORE Tests
         - Add Test coverage and codecov
         - Consider adding "delete" capability (Did not do it since it may be harmful)
        
        
        ### Enhancements & Ideas
        
        I'm open to both! Contact me via the details in Github
