Description: Analogy is an experimental open source project for Natural Language Processing. It aims to perform 2 newly introduced NLP tasks: word comparison and sentence comparison.
        
        Analogy provides semantic similiarity and differences between two pieces of text. Text can be in the form of a word or a sentence.
        
        A pretrained model is released to get started. You can also retrain upon an existing model.
        
        Getting Started:
        
        Prerequisites:
        Python 3.0 or higher
        Stanford Core NLP (3.9.2)
        
        Installing:
        
        pip install analogy
        
        Read instructions on how to install and run stanford corenlp server. 
        
        Analogy functions:
        
        1. findComparison(model, word1, word2)
        2. findSentenceComparison(model, sentence1, sentence2)
        3. trainModel(sentences) #Input is list of sentences
        4. retrainModel(model, sentences)
        5. saveModel(name, model) #Be sure to add '.npz' at last
        6. loadModel(name)
        
        Example:
        
        findComparison(model, "apple", "orange")
        
        Output:
        
        Word1 = apple
        Word2 = orange
        Similiarity = fruit
