Graph operations
----------------

Graph operations such as linear paths merging, multiplication of
segments and other are provided. These operations are implemented
in analogy to those provided by the Ruby library RGFA. As RGFA only
handles GFA1 graphs, only dovetail overlaps are considered as
connections. A detailed description of the operation can be
found in Gonnella and Kurtz (2016). More information about the
single operations are found in the method documentation of the
submodules of `GraphOperations`.
