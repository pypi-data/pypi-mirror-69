At its core, Ploomber is a framework to efficiently develop data pipelines: once you declare a pipeline, you can build it with a single command, next time you build it, Ploomber will skip tasks whose source code has not changed, allowing you to quickly run experiments by skipping redundant long-running computations.


`Try it out now (no installation required) <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ploomber/projects/master?filepath=basic-tutorial%2Fnotebook.ipynb>`_.

`Code on Github <https://github.com/ploomber/ploomber>`_.

Compatible with Python 3.5 and higher.

At a glance
-----------

* Airflow-like syntax to declare **pipelines as code**
* Interactive. Once a pipeline is declared, you can **build it right away**, inspect it, check status or even generate HTML reports, use it in a Python session or a Jupyter notebook
* Fast experimentation. Modify your source code and ploomber will figure out **which tasks to run** and which ones to skip **based on source code changes**
* Test-driven. Use `on_finish` hooks to **check data assumptions** (e.g. verify that an output data frame has no NAs, an "age" column has only positive numbers, etc)
* SQL-friendly. **SQL scripts can be parametrized** for simplicity and consistency using jinja2
* Notebook-friendly. **Generate reports** in Jupyter notebook format (or HTML) by executing parametrized notebooks using papermill
* Switch configurations. Automatically **switch pipeline configuration based on the current environment**, for example, make all pipeline output files go to `/data/project/{{user}}`, where `{{user}}` will be automatically replaced depending on the current user
* Reduce boilerplate code by using the **Tasks library**, for example, dump SQL tables or upload a local file to a database


Install
-------

If you want to try out everything ploomber has to offer:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install "ploomber[all]"

Note that installing everything will attemp to install pygraphviz, which
depends on graphviz, you have to install that first:

.. code-block:: shell

    # if you are using conda (recommended)
    conda install graphviz
    # if you are using homebew
    brew install graphviz
    # for other systems, see: https://www.graphviz.org/download/

If you want to start with the minimal amount of dependencies:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install ploomber


Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

    from ploomber import DAG
    from ploomber.products import File
    from ploomber.tasks import PythonCallable, SQLDump
    from ploomber.clients import SQLAlchemyClient

    dag = DAG()

    # the first task dumps data from the db to the local filesystem
    task_dump = SQLDump('SELECT * FROM example',
                        File(tmp_dir / 'example.csv'),
                        dag,
                        name='dump',
                        client=SQLAlchemyClient(uri),
                        chunksize=None)

    def _add_one(upstream, product):
        """Add one to column a
        """
        df = pd.read_csv(str(upstream['dump']))
        df['a'] = df['a'] + 1
        df.to_csv(str(product), index=False)

    def on_finish(task):
        df = pd.read_csv(str(task.product))
        assert not df['a'].isna().sum()

    # we convert the Python function to a Task
    task_add_one = PythonCallable(_add_one,
                                  File(tmp_dir / 'add_one.csv'),
                                  dag,
                                  name='add_one')
    # verify there are no NAs in columns a
    task_add_one.on_finish = on_finish

    # declare how tasks relate to each other
    task_dump >> task_add_one

    # run the pipeline - incremental builds: ploomber will keep track of each
    # task's source code and will only execute outdated tasks in the next run
    dag.build()

    # a DAG also serves as a tool to interact with your pipeline, for example,
    # status will return a summary table
    dag.status()

    # start a debugging session (only works if task is a PythonCallable)
    dag['add_one'].debug()
