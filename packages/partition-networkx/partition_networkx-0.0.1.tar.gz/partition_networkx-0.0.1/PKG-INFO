Description: # Graph Partition and Measures
        
        Python3 code implementing 11 graph-aware measures (gam) for comparing graph partitions as well as a stable ensemble-based graph partition algorithm (ecg) all for networkx.
        
        ## Graph aware measures (gam)
        
        The measures are respectively:
        * 'rand': the RAND index
        * 'jaccard': the Jaccard index
        * 'mn': pairwise similarity normalized with the mean function
        * 'gmn': pairwise similarity normalized with the geometric mean function
        * 'min': pairwise similarity normalized with the minimum function
        * 'max': pairwise similarity normalized with the maximum function
        
        Each measure can be adjusted (recommended) or not, except for 'jaccard'.

        ## Ensemble clustering for graphs (ecg)
        
        This is a good, stable graph partitioning algorithm. Details for ecg can be found in:

        # Example
        
        First, we need to import the supplied Python file partition_networkx.
        
        ```python
        import networkx as nx
        import community ## this is the python-louvain package which can be pip installed 
        import partition_networkx
        import numpy as np
        ```
        
        Next, let's build a graph with communities (dense subgraphs):
        
        ```python
        # Graph generation with 10 communities of size 100
        commSize = 100
        numComm = 10
        G = nx.generators.planted_partition_graph(l=numComm, k=commSize, p_in=0.1, p_out=0.02)
        ## store groud truth communities as 'iterables of sets of vertices'
        true_comm = [set(list(range(commSize*i, commSize*(i+1)))) for i in range(numComm)]
        ```
        
        run Louvain and ecg:
        
        ```python
        ml = community.best_partition(G)
        ec = community.ecg(G, ens_size=32)
        ```
        
        We show a few examples of measures we can compute with gam:
        
        ```python
        # for 'gam' partition are either iterables of sets of vertices or 'dict'
        print("Adjusted Graph-Aware Rand Index for Louvain:",G.gam(true_comm, ml))
        print("Adjusted Graph-Aware Rand Index for ecg:",G.gam(true_comm, ec.partition))
        
        print("\nJaccard Graph-Aware for Louvain:",G.gam(true_comm, ml, method="jaccard",adjusted=False))
        print("Jaccard Graph-Aware for ecg:",G.gam(true_comm, ec.partition, method="jaccard",adjusted=False))
        ```
        
        Next, we compare with some non graph-aware measure (the adjusted Rand index); note that a different format is required for this function, so we build a dictionary for the partitions.
        
        ```python
        ## adjusted RAND index requires iterables over the vertices:
        from sklearn.metrics import adjusted_rand_score as ARI
        tc = {val:idx for idx,part in enumerate(true_comm) for val in part}
        
        ## compute ARI
        print("Adjusted non-Graph-Aware Rand Index for Louvain:",ARI(list(tc.values()), list(ml.values())))
        print("Adjusted non-Graph-Aware Rand Index for ecg:",ARI(list(tc.values()), list(ec.partition.values())))
        ```
