# Grapejuice

⚠️ A lot of people assume that the Roblox game client will work. To be extremely clear, **Roblox player does NOT work**
 Only Roblox Studio Works.

---

Since recent releases of Wine, Roblox Studio has started being able to run under it once again.
Installing an managing Roblox under Wine can be quite the hassle as Wine itself can create a mess and binding protocol
uri's are not supported by default. Grapejuice aims to address these problems and make Roblox easy to get setup on Linux.

Please note that this project is highly experimental, not everything will work perfectly.

## Installing Grapejuice from source

Installing from source differs per distributions, please follow the appropriate installation guide for yours.
All the installation guides can be found in the [Grapejuice Wiki](https://gitlab.com/brinkervii/grapejuice/wikis/home)

## Note for upgrading from 1.x to 2.x
The builtin Grapejuice updater behaves a bit wonkily upgrading from 1.x to 2.x. Upgrading *does* work.
However, the upgrade button might not indicate such until you relaunch Grapejuice manually.
