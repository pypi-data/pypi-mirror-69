# Poisson Factorization

Very fast and memory-efficient non-negative matrix factorization for sparse counts data, based on Poisson likelihood with regularization. The algorithm is described in ["Fast Non-Bayesian Poisson Factorization for Implicit-Feedback Recommendations"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01908).

The model is similar to [Hierarchical Poisson Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.1704), but uses regularization instead of a bayesian hierarchical structure, and is fit through proximal gradient iteration instead of coordinate ascent, resulting in a procedure which, for larger datasets, can be more than 400x faster than HPF as implemented in the [hpfrec](https://www.github.com/david-cortes/hpfrec) package, and 15x faster than implicit-ALS as implemented in the package [implicit](https://github.com/benfred/implicit).

(Alternatively, can also use L1 regularization or a mixture of L1 and L2, and use a conjugate gradient method instead of proximal gradient)

The implementation is in C with interfaces for Python and R.

# Update 2020-23-05

The conjugate gradient method in this package has been reworked, and it's no longer susceptible to failed optimizations. Using the conjugate gradient method coupled with large numbers of iterations is now very competitive in terms of both quality and speed against other methods such as HPF, but it's nowhere near as fast as the proximal gradient version.

# Model description

This library tries to fit a low-rank factorization model in which some sparse `X` matrix of counts data is assumed to be Poisson-distributed, with parameters given by the product of two non-negative and lower-dimensional matrices - that is:
```X ~ Poisson(A * t(B))```.

The model is fit through maximum likelihood estimation (adding a regularization term) by alternating between updates to the `A` and `B` matrices, exploiting a shortcut for fast evaluation and optimization of Poisson likelihood when the `A` and `B` matrices are constrained to be non-negative and with no link function:

The intended use is for recommender systems, in which users are the rows of the `X` matrices, items the columns, and the non-zero values indicate interactions (e.g. clicks, views, plays, etc.) - the idea being that the items with the highest-predicted value for a given user are the best candidates to recommend. Nevertheless, can also be used for other domains such as topic modeling or as a general dimensionality reduction model - just take any mention of users as rows or documents and any mention of items as columns or words.

# Installation

* Python

Linux and MacOS + GCC:
```
pip install poismf
```
or
```
pip install git+https://www.github.com/david-cortes/poismf.git
```

(might also work on Windows depending on `setuptools` version)

Windows with unlucky `setuptools` version: clone or download the repository and then install with `setup.py`, e.g.:
```
git clone https://github.com/david-cortes/poismf.git
cd poismf
python setup.py install
```
(Note that it requires package `findblas`, can usually be installed with `pip install findblas`. Depending on configuration, in Windows you might also try `python setup.py install --compiler=msvc`).


MacOS without GCC: install OpenMP modules for CLANG (these don't come by default in apple's "special" clang distribution, even though they are part of standard clang), then install with either `pip install poismf` or `python setup.py install`.


Requires some BLAS library such as MKL (`pip install mkl-devel`) or OpenBLAS - will attempt to use the same as NumPy is using. Also requires a C compiler such as GCC or Visual Studio (in windows + conda, install Visual Studio Build Tools, and select package MSVC140 in the install options).

For any installation problems, please open an issue in GitHub providing information about your system (OS, BLAS, C compiler) and Python installation.

* R
```r
install.packages("poismf")
```
or
```r
devtools::install_github("david-cortes/poismf")
```

# Sample usage

* Python

(API is very similar to `cmfrec` library)
```python
import numpy as np, pandas as pd

## Generating random sparse data
nusers = 10 ** 2
nitems = 10 ** 3
nnz    = 10 ** 4

np.random.seed(1)
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'UserId' : np.random.randint(nusers, size = nnz),
    'ItemId' : np.random.randint(nitems, size = nnz),
    'Count'  : 1 + np.random.gamma(1, 1, size = nnz).astype(int)
})
### (can also pass a sparse COO matrix instead)

## Fitting the model
from poismf import PoisMF

### good speed
model = PoisMF()
### good quality
model = PoisMF(use_cg=True)
model.fit(df)

### Predict functionality (chosen entries in X)
model.predict(1, 10) ## entry [1, 10]
model.predict(np.array([1,1,1]), np.array([4,5,6])) ## entries [1,4], [1,5], [1,6]

### Ranking functionality (for recommender systems)
model.topN(user=2, n=5, exclude=df.ItemId.loc[df.UserId==2])
model.topN_new(X=df[["ItemId","Count"]].loc[df.UserId==2],
    n=5, exclude=df.ItemId.loc[df.UserId==2])
## For faster fitting without any checks and castings, can use 'fit_unsafe' too
```

* R

(See example in the documentation for a slightly longer version)

```r
library(poismf)

### Create a random sparse data frame in COO format
nrow <- 10^2
ncol <- 10^3
nnz  <- 10^4
set.seed(1)
X <- data.frame(
    row_ix = sample(nrow, size=nnz, replace=TRUE),
    col_ix = sample(ncol, size=nnz, replace=TRUE),
    count  = rpois(nnz, 1) + 1)
X <- X[!duplicated(X[, c("row_ix", "col_ix")]), ]
### (can also pass as sparse matrix from Matrix or SparseM)

### Factorize the randomly-generated sparse matrix
### good speed
model <- poismf(X, nthreads=1)
### good quality
model <- poismf(X, use_cg=TRUE, nthreads=1)

### Predict functionality (chosen entries in X)
predict(model, 1, 10) ## entry [1, 10]
predict(model, c(1, 1, 1), c(4, 5, 6)) ## entries [1,4], [1,5], [1,6]

### Ranking functionality (for recommender systems)
topN(model, user=2, n=5, exclude=X$col_ix[X$row_ix==2])
topN.new(model, X=X[X$row_ix==2, c("col_ix","count")],
    n=5, exclude=X$col_ix[X$row_ix==2])
```

* C:

You can also take the C file `poismf/poismf.c` and use it in some language other than Python or R - works with a copy of `X` in row-sparse and another in column-sparse formats.

```c

	numiter                     : Number of iterations for which to run the procedure
