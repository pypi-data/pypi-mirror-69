Description: # pyAussieBB
        
        [![Build Status](https://droneio.yaleman.org/api/badges/yaleman/aussiebb/status.svg)](https://droneio.yaleman.org/yaleman/aussiebb)
        
        This is a very simple module for interacting with the Aussie Broadband APIs.
        
        I wrote this so I can pull a line test periodically and show the NBN how garbage they are.
        
        # Usage
        
        ```
        pip install --user pyaussiebb
        python
        >>> from aussiebb import AussieBB
        >>> account = AussieBB(username, password)
        >>> account.get_services()
        [{allyourservicedetails}]
        ```

        # Example tests I've seen
        
        All the "endpoints" should be tacked onto `aussiebb.BASEURL['api']`.
        
        **Warning: `/nbn/{service_id}/connection` seems to have both a GET and POST method endpoint - tests on other endpoints may be similar.**
        
        These can be run by using `AussieBB.run_test()` with the string after the last forward-slash as the "test" - ie, `connection` or `linestate`.
        
        ## FTTC
        
        | Endpoint | Method | Name | Description |
        | --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | `/nbn/{service_id}/connection` | GET |Check Connection | Check to see if your service is currently connected |
        | `/nbn/{service_id}/connection`  | Probably POST |Kick Connection | Kick your current session and force your device to reauthenticate |
        | `/tests/{service_id}/dpuportreset` | Probably POST |DPU Port Reset | Reset the Port on the DPU (Distribution Point Unit) along with clearing any errors that maybe causing issues with connectivity.  |
        | `/tests/{service_id}/dpuportstatus` | POST |DPU Port Status | A DPU (Distribution Point Unit) port status will show if the NCD (Network Connection Device) is providing power to the DPU. It will also state if the NCD (Network Connection Device) is in sync. |
        | `/tests/{service_id}/dpustatus` | POST |DPU Status | This will provide if the DPU (Distribution Point Unit) is currently being powered. |
        | `/tests/{service_id}/loopback` | POST |Loopback Test | This will test the connectivity between the point NBN’s network transitions to ours and to the closest point to your property. Usually either the Network Termination Device or Node. |
        | `/tests/{service_id}/ncdportreset` | Probably POST |NCD Port Reset | Reset the gateway port on your NCD (Network Connection Device). |
        | `/tests/{service_id}/ncdreset` | Probably POST |NCD Reset | This will remotely restart your Network Termination Device. |
        
        ## FTTN
        
        | Endpoint | Method | Name | Description |
        |  --- | --- | --- | --- |
        | `/nbn/{service_id}/connection` | GET | Check Connection | Check to see if your service is currently connected |
        | `/nbn/{service_id}/connection` | Probably POST | Kick Connection | Kick your current session and force your device to reauthenticate |
        | `/tests/{service_id}/linestate` | POST | Line State | A line state test will determine if you have “sync” (connection) to the node. If the service is in sync this test will also return your maximum and current attainable transfer rate. |
        | `/tests/{service_id}/loopback` | POST | Loopback Test | This will test the connectivity between the point NBN’s network transitions to ours and to the closest point to your property. Usually either the Network Termination Device or Node. |
        | `/tests/{service_id}/portreset` | Probably POST | Port Reset | This will reset the connection from the Node and also clear errors that may be causing issues with gaining sync. |
        | `/tests/{service_id}/stabilityprofile` | Probably POST | Stability Profile | This will apply changes to your FTTN service including allowing increased noise to occur before making the connection unstable. This will cause your speeds to degrade as a result, but in turn making the service more stable. For NBN to investigate a fault this profile needs to be applied and a minimum of 5 dropouts recorded over a 24hr period on NBN's systems before a dropout fault can be raised |
