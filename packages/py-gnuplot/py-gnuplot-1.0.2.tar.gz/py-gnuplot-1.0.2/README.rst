`Gnuplot`_ is a portable command-line driven graphing utility for many
platforms. To leverage the powful gnuplot and plot beautiful image in python,
we port gnuplot to python.

1. A glance view and examples tables
====================================

1.1 A glance view
-----------------

**py-python only support python3** since the function dictionary paramaters in
python2 is not in order.

This package has an object-oriented design as well as direct function call to
allows the user flexibility to set plot options and to run multiple gnuplot
sessions simultaneously.

.. _figure1:

At first let's have an intuitive overview by showing an simple example. Will
introduce the detail in the below:


.. figure:: http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo/simple.1.png 

   figure 1. pygnuplot demo 1: simple function

The python script to plot the image is as following, you can run "python3
demo.py" to see the result.

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    #coding=utf8
    from pygnuplot import gnuplot, pyplot

    gnuplot.plot('[-10:10] sin(x)', 'atan(x)', 'cos(atan(x))',
            terminal = 'pngcairo font "arial,10" fontscale 1.0 size 600, 400',
            output = '"simple.1.png"',
            key = 'fixed left top vertical Right noreverse enhanced autotitle box lt black linewidth 1.000 dashtype solid',
            style = 'increment default',
            samples = '50, 50',
            title = '"Simple Plots" font ",20" norotate')

2. Introduction and basic concept
=================================

As we know Gnuplot is a portable and powerful command-line driven graphing
utility for many platforms. To leverage the power of Gnuplot, many wrapper are
developed but it's hard to use. We develop the py-gnuplot in an easy way and
it's streightforward: If you are familar with Gnuplot, you could seamlessly
turn to py-python. If you are not very familar with Gnuplot, you can also write
the gnuplot script in pure python easily.

Gnuplot use 'plot/splot' commands to plot data, use all kinds of 'set/unset'
commands to change the plotting style or options for subsequent plot/splot
command. If we implement the plot()/splot() functions with all those kinds of
options, is it possible for us to call Gnuplot in python script? The answer is
yes. There are several ways to plot the data in py-python:

We take the Gnuplot demo `simple.dem`_ (click to see the original Gnuplot
script) as a example and let's see how to use plot it in pyton way. We have 3
ways to plot the simple function in pyton, they are(plotting function/datafile
and plotting pythong generated data should use different sub module, so  there
are 4 examples):

    - line by line: simple1.1.py_, simple1.1.py_
    - Wrapper as object-oriented interface: simple2.py_
    - global class-less function call: simple3.py_
    - global class-less function call for python generated data: simple4.py_

All the script including the original gnuplot script generate the same output:
`figure1`_, Let's have a deep check how they do it:

2.1 plot data line by line
----------------------------

We implemented the function cmd() and pass the command to call Gnuplot to plot
the data, Thus we could do everything with the only one simple function. It's
the easiest way to call Gnuplot:

.. _simple1.1.py:
.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    #coding=utf8
    from pygnuplot import gnuplot, pyplot

    # Illustration of object-oriented interface, you can see we only wrap the
    # gnuplot script by g.cmd('...') and it's simple and straitfoward if you
    # are familar with Gnuplot.
    g = gnuplot.Gnuplot()
    g.cmd('set terminal pngcairo font "arial,10" fontscale 1.0 size 600, 400')
    g.cmd('set output "simple.1.png"')
    g.cmd('set key fixed left top vertical Right noreverse enhanced autotitle box lt black linewidth 1.000 dashtype solid')
    g.cmd('set style increment default')
    g.cmd('set samples 50, 50')
    g.cmd('set title "Simple Plots" ')
    g.cmd('set title  font ",20" norotate')
    g.cmd('plot [-10:10] sin(x),atan(x),cos(atan(x))')

Or you can even pass the Gnuplot command as a string list or a text paragraph:

.. _simple1.2.py:
.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    #coding=utf8
    from pygnuplot import gnuplot, pyplot

    # Illustration of object-oriented interface, you can see we only wrap the
    # gnuplot script by g.cmd('...') and it's simple and straitfoward if you
    # are familar with Gnuplot.
    g = gnuplot.Gnuplot()

    # Take all the Gnuplot command as a list of command:
    g.cmd('set terminal pngcairo font "arial,10" fontscale 1.0 size 600, 400',
    'set output "simple.1.png"',
    'set key fixed left top vertical Right noreverse enhanced autotitle box lt black linewidth 1.000 dashtype solid',
    'set style increment default',
    'set samples 50, 50',
    'set title "Simple Plots" ',
    'set title  font ",20" norotate',
    'plot [-10:10] sin(x),atan(x),cos(atan(x))')

    # Take all the Gnuplot command as a script paragraph:
    plot_cmd = '''
    set terminal pngcairo font "arial,10" fontscale 1.0 size 600, 400
    set output "simple.1.png"
    set key fixed left top vertical Right noreverse enhanced autotitle box lt black linewidth 1.000 dashtype solid
    set style increment default
    set samples 50, 50
    set title "Simple Plots
    set title  font ",20" norotate
    plot [-10:10] sin(x),atan(x),cos(atan(x))'''
    g.cmd(plot_cmd)

By this way we can do everything that Gnuplot can do and cannot do what
Gnuplot itself can't do. It's the exact way that the Gnuplot do it. and we
don't get any benifit besides we can call Gnuplot in python.

2.2 Wrapper as object-oriented interface
----------------------------------------

As we know Gnuplot use 'plot/splot' commands to plot data, use all kinds of 'set/unset'
commands to change the plotting style or options for subsequent plot/splot
command. So we implement the plot()/splot()/set() and so on functions to draw
the data in python way:

.. _simple2.py:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    #coding=utf8
    from pygnuplot import gnuplot, pyplot

    g = gnuplot.Gnuplot()
    g.set(terminal = 'pngcairo font "arial,10" fontscale 1.0 size 600, 400',
            output = '"simple.1.png"',
            key = 'fixed left top vertical Right noreverse enhanced autotitle box lt black linewidth 1.000 dashtype solid',
            style = 'increment default',
            samples = '50, 50',
            title = '"Simple Plots" font ",20" norotate')
    g.plot('[-10:10] sin(x),atan(x),cos(atan(x))')

We set the options before plot and then call plot to render the image. It's
equivalent to method 1 but seems muck like a python script.

2.3 global class-less function call
-----------------------------------

In above way we need to allocate a Gnuplot object and will use it whenever we
call Gnuplot function. It's convenient but sometimes we only need one the plot
command and don't want to hande the Gnuplot instance, this is a new way to
draw the same image:

.. _simple3.py:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    #coding=utf8
    from pygnuplot import gnuplot, pyplot

    gnuplot.plot('[-10:10] sin(x),atan(x),cos(atan(x))',
            terminal = 'pngcairo font "arial,10" fontscale 1.0 size 600, 400',
            output = '"simple.1.png"',
            key = 'fixed left top vertical Right noreverse enhanced autotitle box lt black linewidth 1.000 dashtype solid',
            style = 'increment default',
            samples = '50, 50',
            title = '"Simple Plots" font ",20" norotate')

This generates exact the same output but is more simple and seems muck like a
python script.

2.4 Plot python generated data
-------------------------------

It's powerful for the above plot function. But they only can plot the
functions and data in file. How about plotting the python generated data?
We've developed another submodule pyplot and you use this summodule with the
same function, there only 2 differeces:

- Use the different submodule name: pyplot.
- plot()/splot() parameter has some differences, we always need pass the df
  (pandas dataframe) as the first paramater in submodule pyplot.

.. _simple4.py:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    #coding=utf8
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    from pygnuplot import gnuplot, pyplot

    # Illusration of submodule: pyplot, Note that we use the pyplot.plot()
    # insteading of gnuplot.plot() in the following line and the parameters
    # are a little difference. See detail in the following section.
    df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(8,3))
    pyplot.plot(df,
            'using 1:2',
            'using 1:3',
            'using 1:4',
            terminal = 'pngcairo font "arial,10" fontscale 1.0 size 600, 400',
            output = '"simple.1.png"',
            key = 'fixed left top vertical Right noreverse enhanced autotitle box lt black linewidth 1.000 dashtype solid',
            style = 'increment default',
            samples = '50, 50',
            title = '"Simple Plots" font ",20" norotate')

3 object-oriented interface and global class-less function call
=================================================================

As we see in section 1, we have several types of script to plot the data, but
they could be classified as two types:

    * object-oriented interface: It's simple wrapper for gnuplot, every
      gnuplot instance is a Gnuplot object and every Gnuplot command is a line
      of python directive. 

    * global class-less function call: It refer to the syntax of matplotlib
      and mplfinance, only a few single function could plot what you want.

The same functions could bey achieved by both kinds of call way,
object-oriented interface call is object-oriented and global class-less
function call is simple, it's your up to decide which way to use.

Let's see what's the difference with more examples(Click the script name to
see the whole script) in Table1_ and Table2_:

As describe above, object-oriented interface is simple and easy to understand
as gnuplot's logic. Easy way plot the data in python way.

4. Sub moduels: gnuplot and pyplot
==================================

We develop two submodule for different use cases:

    * gnuplot: To plot the functions and file data as in gnuplot. 
    * pyplot: To plot the data generated in python itself, normally it's in
      `pandas dataframe`_ format.

.. _pandas dataframe: https://pandas.pydata.org/

For each submodule, we both have an object-oriented interface (via class
Gnuplot) and a few global class-less functions (plot(), splotlot3d(),
multiplot()).

Let's see what's the difference with more examples(Click the script name to
see the whole script) in section3:

5. Gnuplot command and py-gnuplot functions
============================================

The principle is if you can write Gnuplot script, you can write py-gnuplot.
There is 1-1 mapping between almost all Gnuplot command and python function;

Gnuplot commands are mapped to py-python function. Gnuplot has many Commands
but there is only a few ones which are related plot. We will portting more and
more commands and now the following commands are available.

5.1 plot()
-----------

plot is the primary command for drawing plots with gnuplot::

    plot {<ranges>} <plot-element> {, <plot-element>, <plot-element>}

    # Examples:
    plot sin(x)
    plot sin(x), cos(x)
    plot "datafile.1" with lines, "datafile.2" with points

We port it as a function in py-python and the plot-element is passed as
variable parameters, please be noted that the plot-element should be in the
single quotation marks:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    #coding=utf8
    from pygnuplot import gnuplot, pyplot

    # gnuplot.plot() is definied as:
    # def plot(*args, **kwargs)

    # usage examples, please note that we didn't give the
    # output so # could only see the image flash on the
    # screen. Will introduce how to output the image to
    # files.
    gnuplot.plot('sin(x)')
    gnuplot.plot('sin(x)', 'cos(x)')
    gnuplot.plot('"datafile.1" with lines',
                '"datafile.2" with points')

.. important:: Submodule gnuplot and submodule pyplot have difference in plot(), gnuplot.plot() support functions and file data while pyplot.plot() support pandas dataframe data type. Further more pyplot.plot() pass the df as the first parameter. This is the only difference between gnuplot submodule and pyplot module.

If we generate the data in the python insteading using the exist funtions and
datafile, we should use pyplot to plot the data, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    #coding=utf8
    from pygnuplot import gnuplot, pyplot

    # pyplot.plot() is definied as:
    # def plot(df, *args, **kwargs)

    # usage examples, please note that we didn't give the output so could only
    # see the image flash on the screen. Will introduce how to output the
    # image to files.
    df = pd.DataFrame(data = {'col1': [1, 2],
                              'col2': [3, 4],
                              'col3': [5, 6]})
    gnuplot.plot(df, 'using 1:2 with lines', 'using 1:3 with points')


5.2 splot()
------------

splot is the command for drawing 3D plots::

    splot {<ranges>}
    {<iteration>}
    <function> | {{<file name> | <datablock name>} {datafile-modifiers}}

    # Examples:
    splot sin(sqrt(x**2+y**2))/sqrt(x**2+y**2)
    splot ’<file_name>’

We port it as a function splot() in py-python and the plot-element is passed
as variable parameters, please be noted that the plot-element should be in the
single quotation marks:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    #coding=utf8
    from pygnuplot import gnuplot, pyplot

    # gnuplot.splot() is definied as:
    # def splot(*args, **kwargs)

    # usage examples, please note that we didn't give the output so
    # could only see the image flash on the screen. Will introduce
    # how to output the image to files.
    gnuplot.splot('sin(sqrt(x**2+y**2))/sqrt(x**2+y**2)')
    gnuplot.splot('"<file_name>"')

5.3 set()
----------

The set command can be used to set lots of options in gnuplot. for example::

    set xtics offset 0,graph 0.05
    set label "y=x" at 1,2
    set label 2 "S" at graph 0.5,0.5 center font "Symbol,24"
    set label 3 "y=x^2" at 2,3,4 right

In py-gnuplot we use dictionary parameter to pass them to plot() function, We
use each option name as the key, the option value as the dictionary value.
If some option contain an iteration clause, we use list as the dictionary value,
then the above set command could be writen as::

    xtics = 'offset 0,graph 0.05'
    labes = ['"y=x" at 1,2',
             '2 "S" at graph 0.5,0.5 center font "Symbol,24"',
             '3 "y=x^2" at 2,3,4 right']

For example the following Gnuplot script::

    set boxwidth 0.9 relative
    set style fill solid 1.0
    set label "y=x" at 1,2
    set label 2 "S" at graph 0.5,0.5 center font "Symbol,24"
    set label 3 "y=x^2" at 2,3,4 right
    plot ’file.dat’ with boxes

could be implemented as the following:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    #coding=utf8
    from pygnuplot import gnuplot, pyplot

    # style is passed as function dictionary parameter
    gnuplot.plot('"file.dat’with boxes',
                boxwidth = '0.9 relative',
                style = 'fill solid 1.0',
                labes = ['"y=x" at 1,2',
                '2 "S" at graph 0.5,0.5 center font "Symbol,24"',
                '3 "y=x^2" at 2,3,4 right'])

By default, Gnuplot display the output to the standard output. The set term
and output command redirects the display to the specified file or device::

    set terminal pngcairo font "arial,10" fontscale 1.0 size 600, 400
    set output "test.png"

Then if we want to redirect the image to a file, we could do that by giving
the term and output parameters:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    #coding=utf8
    from pygnuplot import gnuplot, pyplot

    # style is passed as function dictionary parameter
    gnuplot.plot('"file.dat’with boxes',
                boxwidth = '0.9 relative',
                style = 'fill solid 1.0',
                labes = ['"y=x" at 1,2',
                '2 "S" at graph 0.5,0.5 center font "Symbol,24"',
                '3 "y=x^2" at 2,3,4 right'],
                output = '"finance.13.png"',
                term = 'pngcairo font "arial,10" fontscale 1.0 size 900, 600')


5.4 multiplot()
----------------

In Gnuplot, multiplot is not a command but a option to enable multiplot mode.
But we use it as a seperate function multiplot() to plot several data next to
each other on the same page or screen window::

    def multiplot(\*args, \*\*kwargs):
        @args: the subplot object list;
        @kwargs: the setting options that need to be set before call plot;

    def make_subplot(\*args, \*\*kwargs)
        The parameter definition is the same as plot()/splot, but it doesn't
        plot the df really, it only return the plot dictionary for later
        multiplot() use.

Before call multiplot() we must generate the subplot object by calling
make_subplot(), It is much like mplfinance.add_plot(), it only add the subplot
command for further call:

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    #coding=utf8
    from pygnuplot import gnuplot, pyplot

    sub1 = gnuplot.make_subplot('sin(x)', ylabel = 'ylabel')
    sub2 = gnuplot.make_subplot('cos(x)', xlabel = 'xlabel')
    sub3 = gnuplot.make_subplot('sin(2*x)', noxlabel = '', ylabel = '')
    sub4 = gnuplot.make_subplot('cos(2*x)', xlabel = 'xlabel')
    gnuplot.multiplot(sub1, sub2, sub3, sub4,
                      output = '"sample.multiplot.png"',
                      term = 'pngcairo size 900,600 font ",11"',
                      multiplot  = 'layout 2,2 columnsfirst margins 0.1,0.9,0.1,0.9 spacing 0.1')

6. Plot methods detail
======================

6.1 methods in gnuplot
-----------------------

6.2 methods in pyplot
-----------------------

pyplot is easy to use and it only has a few functions, all the configuration
are passed as function parameter.

pyplot take pandas dataframe as data.

plot(df, \*args, \*\*kwargs)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

@ df: The data that need to plot. it should be pandas dataframe format.
In gnuplot we pass the data as a function or data file. But normally in
python script, we normally get the data in the memory, not in the file. So
we develop the submodule to plot the data in memory, we should pass the df
in pandas dataframe format, for example::

    df = pd.read_csv('immigration.dat', index_col = 0,
                    sep='\t', comment='#')
    pyplot.plot(df, ...)

@ args: The plot command we need to plot. Gnuplot plot data like that::

    plot 'finance.dat' using 0:2:3:4:5 notitle with financebars lt 8, \
         'finance.dat' using 0:9 notitle with lines lt 3, \
         'finance.dat' using 0:10 notitle with lines lt 1, \
         'finance.dat' using 0:11 notitle with lines lt 2

Now we omit the command "plot" and data "finance.dat" since we have
already pass them in the function name and the first parameter "df", we
pass the command as a list of command as following::

    pyplot.plot(df,
                'using 0:2:3:4:5 notitle with financebars lt 8',
                'using 0:9 notitle with lines lt 3',
                'using 0:10 notitle with lines lt 1',
                'using 0:11 notitle with lines lt 2',
                ...)

@ kwargs: As we know The set command is
used to set lots of options before plot, splot, or replot command is
given. We skip the 'set' keyword and use the options name as the key, the
following part is used the attribute value, for example we use the
following line to set the xtics in gnuplot::

    set xtics border in scale 1,0.5 nomirror rotate by -45 autojustify norangelimit

Then in the function, we will use::

    xtics = 'border in scale 1,0.5 nomirror rotate by -45 autojustify norangelimit'

as a parameters. Some options order sensitive, so we need the python
version > 3.7, which seems to pass the function parameter in order. Or there will
some issue and cause exception::

    pyplot.plot(df,
                'using 0:2:3:4:5 notitle with financebars lt 8',
                ...,
                xtics = 'border in scale 1,0.5 nomirror rotate by -45 autojustify norangelimit',
                ...)

There are some cases we need pay attention:

1) We need always put the parameter in the single quotation marks('') since we
   would pass the integrated string to gnuplot by PIPE::

    pyplot.plot(df,
                'using 0:2:3:4:5 notitle with financebars lt 8',
                ...,
                )

2) If it's flag parameter, for example::

    set grid
    set hidden3d

we can pass it as a empty value::

    pyplot.plot(df,
                'using 0:2:3:4:5 notitle with financebars lt 8',
                ...,
                grid = '',
                hidden3d = '',
                ...)

3) unset command use the no-xxx option, for example::

    unset grid
    unset hidden3d

As we know they equal to::

    set nogrid
    set nohidden3d

So the use them as::

    pyplot.plot(df,
                'using 0:2:3:4:5 notitle with financebars lt 8',
                ...,
                nogrid = '',
                nohidden3d = '',
                ...)

4) If there is multiple lines for one options, for exampe in gnuplot it is::

    set arrow from 5,-5,-1.2 to 5,5,-1.2 lt -1
    set arrow from 5,6,-1 to 5,5,-1 lt -1
    set arrow from 5,6,sinc(5,5) to 5,5,sinc(5,5) lt -1

We pass them by a list of options::

    pyplot.plot(df,
                'using 0:2:3:4:5 notitle with financebars lt 8',
                ...,
                arrow = ['from 5,-5,-1.2 to 5,5,-1.2 lt -1',
                         'from 5,6,-1 to 5,5,-1 lt -1',
                         'from 5,6,sinc(5,5) to 5,5,sinc(5,5) lt -1'],
                ...,
                ...)


splot(df, \*args, \*\*kwargs)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The parameter are same as plot(), the only difference is it use "splot" to
plot insteading of "plot".

make_subplot(df, \*args, \*\*kwargs)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The parameter definition is the same as plot()/splot, but it doesn't plot the
df really, it only return the plot dictionary for later multiplot() use.

It is much like mplfinance.add_plot(), it only add the subplot command for
further call::

    sub1 = pyplot.make_subplot(df,
            'using 0:2:3:4:5 notitle with candlesticks lt 8',
            'using 0:9 notitle with lines lt 3',
            logscale = 'y',
            yrange = '[75:105]',
            ytics = '(105, 100, 95, 90, 85, 80)',
            xrange = '[50:253]',
            grid = 'xtics ytics',
            lmargin = '9',
            rmargin = '2',
            format = 'x ""',
            xtics = '(66, 87, 109, 130, 151, 174, 193, 215, 235)',
            title = '"Change to candlesticks"',
            size = ' 1, 0.7',
            origin = '0, 0.3',
            bmargin = '0',
            ylabel = '"price" offset 1',
            label = ['1 "Acme Widgets" at graph 0.5, graph 0.9 center front',
                '2 "Courtesy of Bollinger Capital" at graph 0.01, 0.07',
                '3 "  www.BollingerBands.com" at graph 0.01, 0.03']
            )

multiplot(\*args, \*\*kwargs)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The multiplot set the setting in kwargs at first, and then call the
subplot in args to multiplot.

@args: It is the list of subplot generated by make_subplot(), it would be
called one by one.

@kwargs: The global setting for multiplot;

For example::

    pyplot.multiplot(sub1, sub2,
            output = '"history.%s.png"' %(code),
            term = 'pngcairo size 1920,1080 font ",11"')

multisplot(\*args, \*\*kwargs)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It's the same as multiplot, the difference is it use splot() instead.

8. Q/A
======

9. TODO
============

The 0.1 release only support plot/multiplot, will support splot/multisplot the
next release
