# ------------------------ Custom Markov shuffling --------------------------- #

"""
This will "shuffle" lists using an order 2 Markov model.

WARNING : This is not strictly a shuffle, since the resulting arrays will have
different elements. It is more akin to generating a new array based on the
"Markovian" characteristics of the old one, in terms of order of elements.

This is not recommended in the general case, and should only be used if you
suspect there is an order to the data that you want to keep.

Markov shuffling is very much in BETA-TEST at the moment. Please note that :
  - This will be very time consuming (hours).
  - When modeling overlap statistics (such as total overlap length), a negative
  binomial cannot be used here, the resulting distribution is often multimodal
  and not a good fit for any of the basic probability distributions.
  - This will result in a higher number of intersections and number of overlapping
  base pairs than the basic shuffle. Even when comparing a BED file against itself,
  you may find the BED file to be "significantly anticorrelated with itself" because
  the Markov shuffle will generate a new BED file based on the characteristics
  of the old one, resulting in a more patterned distribution.
