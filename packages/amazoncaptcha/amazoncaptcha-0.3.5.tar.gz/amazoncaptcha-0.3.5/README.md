Motivation behind creation of this library is taking its start from the genuinely simple idea: "***I don't want to use pytesseract or some other non-amazon-specific OCR services, nor do I want to install some executables to just solve a captcha. My desire is to get a solution within 1-2 lines of code without any heavy add-ons. Using a pure Python.***"

Pure Python, lightweight, [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)-based solver for the [Amazon's text captcha](https://www.amazon.com/errors/validateCaptcha).

## Installation
```bash
pip install amazoncaptcha
```

## Quick Snippet
```python
from amazoncaptcha import AmazonCaptcha

captcha = AmazonCaptcha('captcha.jpg')
solution = captcha.solve()

# Or: solution = AmazonCaptcha('captcha.jpg').solve()
```

## Popular Usage
```python
from amazoncaptcha import AmazonCaptcha
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get('https://www.amazon.com/errors/validateCaptcha')

captcha = AmazonCaptcha.from_webdriver(driver)
solution = captcha.solve()
```

## For Whom?
+ **Data extraction** and **web scraping** specialists could use this tool, obviously, to bypass the Amazon captcha.
+ **Machine learning** developers could use [captchas](https://github.com/a-maliarov/amazon-captcha-solver/tree/master/captchas) folder (currently contains **13000 unique solved captchas**) based on a demand.

## Issues
+ If you constantly receive 'Not solved' output, feel free to create an issue and describe details.
+ If you received an output, different from solution itself or 'Not solved', please, create an issue or contact me.
+ If you've somehow met an Exception, which you don't understand - you know what to do :)
