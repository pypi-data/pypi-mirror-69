Description: # Amazon Captcha Solver
        Pure Python, lightweight, [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)-based solver for the [Amazon's text captcha](https://www.amazon.com/errors/validateCaptcha).
        
        Motivation behind creation of this library is taking its start from the genuinely simple concept: "**I don't want to use pytesseract or some other non-amazon-specific OCR services, neither do I want to install some executables to just solve a captcha. My desire is to get a solution within 1-2 lines of code without any heavy add-ons. Using a pure Python.**"

        ## Popular Usage
        ```python
        from amazoncaptcha import AmazonCaptcha
        from selenium import webdriver
        
        driver = webdriver.Chrome()
        driver.get('https://www.amazon.com/errors/validateCaptcha')
        
        captcha = AmazonCaptcha.from_webdriver(driver)
        solution = captcha.solve()
        ```
        
        ## For Whom?
        + **Data extraction** and **web scraping** specialists could use this tool, obviously, to bypass the Amazon captcha.
        + **Machine learning** developers could use [captchas](https://github.com/a-maliarov/amazon-captcha-solver/tree/master/captchas) folder (currently contains **15000 solved captchas**) based on a demand.
        
        ## Issues
        + If you constantly receive 'Error' output, feel free to create an issue and describe details.
        + If you received an output, different from solution itself, 'Error' or 'Not solved', please, create an issue or contact me.
        + If you've somehow met an Exception, which you don't understand - you know what to do :)
