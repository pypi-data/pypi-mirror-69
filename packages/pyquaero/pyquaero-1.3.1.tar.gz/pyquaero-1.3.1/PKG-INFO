Description: # pyquaero
        
        This is a Python library and web service for accessing [Aquaero](https://aquacomputer.de/aquaero-5.html) fan and pump controllers by Aqua Computer GmbH & Co. KG.
        
        _pyquaero_ is a community open source project. It is not endorsed by or affiliated with Aqua Computer.
        
        ## USE THIS SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
        
        The _pyquaero_ main developer is running this software for several years now, without any negative side effects. However, it is a highly experimental software, and it is based on reverse engineering only.
        
        * This software might damage your Aquaero device in a way that it must be repaired or replaced.
        * The use of this software could lead to failure of cooling fans or aqua pumps, which might cause permanent damage to heat sensitive components of your system.
        * Using this software might void your warranty.
        
        Neither the _pyquaero_ developers nor the manufacturer can be held liable for any damage caused by this software.
        
        It is strongly recommended to use only the official software!
        
        ## Usage
        
        _pyquaero_ is only compatible to a limited number of Aquaero firmware versions. Please check first whether the [firmware version](https://shredzone.org/docs/pyquaero/firmware/) on your Aquaero is actually supported by _pyquaero_.
        
        See the [documentation](https://shredzone.org/docs/pyquaero/index.html) for how the library and tools are used.
