# Welcome to Remo
This the open source repository for Remo python library.

Remo is an open-access web-application for managing and visualising images and annotations for Computer Vision. 

Use Remo to:

- **visualise and inspect** datasets and annotations
- **organise and search** your images
- **visualise statistics** like # objects per class
- **quickly annotate** your images

Remo runs on Windows, Linux and Mac. It is written using Python and React.JS and uses a lightweight database to store metadata.

## Quick installation

1. In a Python 3.6+ environment: `pip install remo` 

This will install both the Python library and the remo app.
If it is installed in a conda environment, calling ` import remo` will also automatically launch remo. Otherwise, you can call it with `python -m remo_app` from command line.

2- Initialise config: `python -m remo_app init`

## For contributors

The SDK is organized in 3 main layers:
- api
- sdk
- domain objects, such as datasets

We exepect the end user to use mainly the SDK layer and domain objets.

`API` is responsible for low level communication with the server. It mostly returns raw data.

`SDK` doesn't access backend endpoints directly, rather it uses the `API` layer for that. This layer knows about domain objects, 
so instead of raw data, it returns domain objects.

`Domain objects` keeps entity information and knows about the `SDK` layer. Most functions are simple short-hands for sdk methods.
This layer doesn't know anything about `API`. 



### Naming conventions

* Functions which are responsible to open the UI on a specific page use the `view_` prefix
    
        view_dataset, view_annotations

* Functions which return always only one object, present the name of that object in singular form.
    
        get_image(id) - returns one image

* Functions which might return multiple objects use the plural form of that object
    
        get_images() - may return multiple images
