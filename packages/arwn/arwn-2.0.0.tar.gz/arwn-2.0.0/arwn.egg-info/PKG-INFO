        Collect 433Mhz weather sensor data and publish to mqtt.
        
        This software is designed to use an rfxcom usb receiver or an rtl 433
        compatible receiver, and relay the data found on it over an mqtt bus
        so that it can be consumed by other software, such as Home Assistant.
        
        Installation Requirements
        =========================
        
        You will need a Linux system (raspberry pi is sufficient) and a 433
        MHz receiver. This supports either rfxcom receivers for rtl-sdr
        dongles.
        
        - Install hardware + support code
        
          - If using an rfxcom receiver, all supporting software is included.
        
          - If using an rtl-sdr dongle, you must also install the rtl433
            project from source.
        
        - pip install arwn
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        Copy the config.yml.sample file and modify it accordingly.
