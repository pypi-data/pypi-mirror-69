        ## About Geometry3D
        
        Geometry3D is a simple python computational geographics library written in python.
        This library focuses on the functions and lacks efficiency which might be improved in future version.
        
        
        ## Core Features
        - Basic 3D Geometries: Point, Line, Plane, Segment, Convex Polygen and Convex Polyhedron.
        - Simple Object like Cubic, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone, Rectangle, Parallepiped, Parallogram and Circle.  
        - Basic Attributes Of Geometries: length, area, volume.
        - Basic Relationships And Operations Between Geometries: move, angle, parallel, orthogonal, intersection.
        - Overload Build-In Functions Such As `__contains__`, `__hash__`, `__eq__`, `__neg__`.
        - A Naive Renderer Using `matplotlib`.

        Some of the code comes from [sgl](https://github.com/Kingdread/sgl) whose author is really humorous.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * [Python](http://www.python.org) 3 
        * No additional third-party library is required, it's written in pure python and standard library. 
        * Matplotlib is needed if you want to use the renderer.
