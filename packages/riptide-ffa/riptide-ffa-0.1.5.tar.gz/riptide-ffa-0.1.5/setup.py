# NOTE: It is necessary to also have a custom build_py command !
# During the first 'pip install' on a given machine, pip caches the packages
# with all its build files into a wheel (.whl). To do so, it runs the
# 'build_py' command and stores all resulting files in the .whl. If 'build_py'
# does not call build_actions(), then the .whl will NOT contain the compiled 
# binaries. And in this case, running pip install another time (in another 
# conda environment for example) actually installs that cached .whl which 
# contains no binaries, and the module does not work.
