        Overview
        ----
        NSCA is the remote passive acceptance daemon used with many Nagios installs. It
        ships with a (C-language) executable called `send_nsca` for submitting checks.
        This is a mostly-clean re-implementation of `send_nsca` in pure-python. It
        supports 10 of the 26 crypto functions used by upstream NSCA, sending to
        multiple hosts with one invocation, and timeouts.
        
        Why send_nsca3?
        ----
        Python3 compatible version of send_nsca, packaged for pypi installation. Just a
        personal convenience thing, as as none of libraries for sending nsca checks 
        support python3, and the projects don't seem active.

        Testing
        -----
        The unit/integration tests for this package are located in the `tests/`
        directory.  Unit tests only require the unittest package (or python 2.7+)
        and the mock library; integration tests also require the `nsca` binary. To
        run them, simply make sure that your `$PYTHONPATH` is set up correctly and
        run `nosetests -v tests`.
        
        Installing
        -----
        This software uses setuptools/distutils; you can install it with `sudo python setup.py install`,
        and it's easy to write packaging for your favorite OS.
