Getting started
===============

* Add the ``sitemetrics`` application to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your settings file (usually ``settings.py``).
* Add ``{% load sitemetrics %}`` tag to the top of a template (usually base template, e.g. ``_base.html``).
* Use ``./manage.py migrate`` to install sitemetrics tables into your database.


Quick example
-------------

You have two options to add metrics counters code to your pages:


1. Let's add Google Analytics counter without Admin Contrib involvement add 
   a ``four arguments`` sitemetrics tag into your template::

     {% sitemetrics by google for "UA-000000-0" %}


   Here: ``google`` is a metrics provider alias; ``UA-000000-0`` - metrics counter keycode.


2. Now let's use ``no arguments`` sitemetrics tag notation to place metrics counter
   code associated through the Admin Contrib with the current site (if any)::

     {% sitemetrics %}

You're done.


.. note:: Since v0.6.0 counter code in DEBUG mode is replaced with
   ``<!-- sitemetrics counter removed on DEBUG -->`` to keep stats clean.
   If you wish to see counter code in DEBUG set ``SITEMETRICS_ON_DEBUG`` to ``True`` in project settings file.
