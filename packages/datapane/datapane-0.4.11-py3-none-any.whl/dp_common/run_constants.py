# TODO - most these dirs / statics can be removed with new runner mechanism

# Directories

# From Ed:
# the subdirs were split into user/system/internal iirc. user is the dir that all files a user
# writes go into, system is where all the system files are written to (so thats input/output arrow,
# the result json, etc), and internal are where additional files that aren't user go into
# (such as the dataframe statistics. all files that we want stored as 'additional files' but we
# create not the user). the perms should be set so that the user cannot traverse into those from
# their scripts. (note the perms on the parent /runner dir not having the exec bit iirc)
#
# so, regarding the paths that can be set via the command line args to the inner process. the basic
# premise is that those are controlled by the outer process and they need to be communicated to the
# inner process somehow. that could be via the shared `run_constants.py` module for instance, or it
# could be that they're passed in via the cmd line args (or env vars). I think I went for the latter
# for ease of testing (we don't have them but potentially for tests run in multiplae threads where
# those args can be supplied by the equivalent of `mktemp -d`). In my testing when writing I ended
# up with many clashes on test files that hadn't been deleted from the last test, so was easy just
# to pass those in so they would be fresh tmp dirs each time.
