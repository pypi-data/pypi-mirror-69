        PyRate is a Python tool for estimating the average displacement rate (velocity) and cumulative displacement time-series of surface movements for every pixel in a stack of geocoded unwrapped interferograms generated by Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) processing. PyRate uses a "Small Baseline Subset" (SBAS) processing strategy and currently supports input data in the GAMMA or ROI_PAC software formats.
        
        The PyRate project started in 2012 as a partial Python translation of "Pirate", a Matlab tool developed by the University of Leeds and the Guangdong University of Technology.

        Install
        -------
        
        Details of all install options are given in the `PyRate documentation <http://geoscienceaustralia.github.io/PyRate>`_.
        
        `PyRate` and its Python dependencies can be installed directly from the `Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/project/Py-Rate/>`_:
        
        ::
        
            pip install Py-Rate
        
        To install from source in Linux, enter these commands in a terminal:
        
        ::
        
            cd ~
            git clone https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/PyRate.git
            python3 -m venv ~/PyRateVenv
            source ~/PyRateVenv/bin/activate
            cd ~/PyRate
            python3 setup.py install
        
        This will install the above-listed Python dependencies and compile the executable program ``pyrate``:
        
        ::
        
            >> pyrate --help
            usage: pyrate [-h] [-v {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR}]

                prepifg             Perform multilooking and cropping on geotiffs.
                process             Main processing workflow including corrections, time series and stacking computation.
                merge               Reassemble computed tiles and save as geotiffs.
                workflow            Run all the PyRate processes
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -v {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR}, --verbosity {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR}

        Release History
        ===============
        0.4.1 (2020-05-19)
        -----------------------
        Added
        +++++
        - Python 3.8 support.
        - Algorithm to automatically calculate rows and columns for tiling.
          User no longer specifies these as part of the CLI, but can optionally
          specify ``rows`` and ``cols`` in the configuration file.
        - Improvements to the test suite, including systems-wide tests.
        - Improved logging.
        
        Changed
        +++++++
        - ``Linear Rate`` algorithm has been renamed ``Stack Rate``.
        - User supplies full paths to input files in respective file lists.
        - All files generated by `PyRate` saved to user-defined ``outdir`` directory.
        - Fixed a bug in how NaNs are handled during coherence masking and multi-looking.
          Output rasters will contain ``nan`` as the nodata value.
        - Fixed bug in resampling/multi-looking when coherence masking is used.
          This bugfix will result in significantly fewer ``nan`` pixels in the outputs.
        - Renamed ``slcfilelist`` parameter to ``hdrfilelist``.
        - Log files are generated in the ``outdir`` and every `PyRate` step produces independent log files.
        
        Removed
        +++++++
        - Deprecate the use of ``obsdir``, ``slcfiledir`` and ``cohdir`` configuration variables.
        - Deprecate ``parallel = 2`` option; splitting image via rows for parallelisation.

        - Reduced console output, default verbosity setting is now ``INFO``.
        - Restructure of code layout, src modules now in ``PyRate/pyrate/core`` directory
          and scripts at ``PyRate/scripts``.
        - Reference pixel values are expected to be in latitude and longitude values.
