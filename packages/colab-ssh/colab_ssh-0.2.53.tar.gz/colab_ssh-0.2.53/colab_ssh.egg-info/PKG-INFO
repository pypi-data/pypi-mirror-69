Description: # Google Colab-ssh
        #### Connect to Google colab via ssh easily
        
        ## What is Colab-ssh
        Colab-ssh is a light-weight library that enables you to connect to a Google Colab virtual machine using an SSH tunnel.
        
        > User interface is still required in order to create the Colab virtual machine
        
        ## Installation
        To install Colab-ssh library, you need to run this command
        ```bash
        pip install colab_ssh --upgrade --user
        ```
        
        ## Getting started
        1. Open Google Colab and run this code in one of the code cells
        ```jupyter
        # Install colab_ssh
        !pip install colab_ssh --upgrade
        
        from colab_ssh import launch_ssh, init_git
        launch_ssh(ngrokToken,password)
        
        # Optional: if you want to clone a github repository
        init_git(githubUrl)
        ```
        
        - `password` is your ssh password that you want to choose
        - `ngrokToken` is your ngrok token that you can get from [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/auth)
        - `githubUrl` is your github **HTTPS** clone url (usually ends with `.git`)
        
        ### Avoiding passwords
        Instead of setting a password, you can access the SSH tunnel using your own pair of keys.
        
        > **IMPORTANT**: For this to work you need to setup your git repository by using the function `git_init()`
        
        **How it works ?** : We get your **public key** from the repository passed into the `git_init()` function and then we add it to the  `authorized_keys` file (found in `~/.ssh` folder).
        
        You need to follow these steps:
        1. Create a pair of SSH key
        2. Copy your **public key** (should be inside the file `id_rsa.pub`)
        3. In the root of your github repository, create a folder called `.colab_ssh` and a file within it called `authorized_keys`
        4. Paste your **public key** inside the file `.collab_ssh/authorized_keys`
        
        
        ### Using VSCode to connect Google Colab
        Once you run the code in the **Getting Started** section you will notice a message like this
        ```
        ...
        Successfully running tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:XXXX
        ...
        ```
        - `XXXX` is the port provided by `ngrok`
        
        You can now open **VSCode** and add this to your SSH Configuration
        ```
        Host google_colab_ssh
          HostName 0.tcp.ngrok.io
          User root
          Port XXXX
        ```
        > Make sure you replace XXXX with the port you just obtained
        
        Then connect to the remote `google_colab_ssh`.
