        ## What is deemix?
        deemix is a deezer downloader built from the ashes of Deezloader Remix. The base library (or core) can be used as a stand alone CLI app or implemented in an UI using the API.
        
        ## How can I use this?
        Currently there are no available builds as it's still in development.<br>
        But you can try to run it yourself!<br>
        
        ## Running instructions
        ### Standard way
        NOTE: Python 3 is required for this app. Make sure you tick the option to add Python to PATH when installing.<br>
        NOTE: If `python3` is "not a recognized command" try using `python` instead.<br>
        <br>
        1. After installing Python open a terminal/command prompt and install the dependencies using `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt --user`<br>
        2. Run `python3 -m deemix --help` to see how to use the app in CLI mode.<br>
        3. Run `python3 server.py` to start the server and then connect to `127.0.0.1:9666`. The GUI should show up.<br>
        4. Enjoy!<br>
        
        ### Easy Windows way
        1. Download `install.bat` file to your PC and place it in the folder where you want Deemix to live<br>
        2. Start the `install.bat` as administrator<br>
        3. Wait for it to finish, then run the `start.bat`<br>
        
        ### Easy Mac way
        1. Download `install_mac.sh` file to your Mac and place it in the folder where you want Deemix to live<br>
        2. Open a terminal and type `sh` and a space, then drag `install_mac.sh` into your terminal window and press `enter`<br>
        3. The web-gui will launch when the installer is finished, and launching it in the future can be done with the generated file `startdeemix.command`<br>
        4. To update to the latest build, run the generated file `updatedeemix.command`<br>
        
        ## What's left to do?
        Library:
        - Write the API Documentation
        
        in the WebUI:
        - Make the UI look coherent
          - Style text inputs
          - Style checkboxes
          - Style buttons
        - Search tab
        	- Better placeholer before search
        	- Better loading feadback fot the user (maybe with a loading circle)
        - Link Analyzer
        	- Better placeholer before analyzing
        - Settings tab
        	- Maybe tabbing the section for easy navigation
        - About tab
        	- Write stuff about the app
        - Install sass dependency
        - ?
        
        Application:
        - Feedback when the link analysis did not work (e.g. with playlist)
        - Add an auto updater
        - Add installer for windows
        - AppImage builds
