<h1>Saving and restoring an entire session (save, restore)</h1>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>save <em>filename</em></p>
<p>restore <em>filename</em></p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The <em>save</em> command saves the entire session: variables, methods
and blocks - including every row and variables set specifically for
the block.
</p>

<p>
To restore a session, use the <em>restore</em> command
</p>

<p>
The <em>save</em> command cannot save tower objects. Towers will therefore
need to be redeclared after a <em>restore</em>. One way of doing so is
to create a script to run <em>restore</em>, followed by the tower
declarations and then running <em>input</em> on the script.
