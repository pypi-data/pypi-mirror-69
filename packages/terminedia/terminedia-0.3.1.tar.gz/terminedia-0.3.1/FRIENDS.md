or simply do similar things, or are essential for working with terminedia:

# UNSCII font project:
http://pelulamu.net/unscii/
The UNSCII fonts are a few fonts created thinking in
vintage text-art, extending it to UNICODE.
Actually, terminedia currently _embedds_ the raster version
of all UNSCII fonts, and those are used for drawing large-block
text. Besides that, it is a very useful font, if not essential,
to use terminedia under Windows, as it features the block-characters
that are used as pixels.

# CMDER terminl emulator
https://cmder.net/
Rather complete terminal experience made available under Windows.
AMong other things, allow easy configuring of the fonts to be used
for graphics (see UNSCII above), without which terminedia drawing
simply wonÂ´t work.

(NB: Colorama is usd by terminedia itself on Windows, as has a "low level" api that makes
the ANSI codes interface seamlessly available on that system)
