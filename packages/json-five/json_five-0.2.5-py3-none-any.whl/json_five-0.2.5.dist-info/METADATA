## Installation

```
pip install json-five
```

This project requires Python 3.6 or newer.

## Usage

**NOTE:** the import name is different from the install name (sorry, many were taken already)

```python
>>> import json5
>>> json_text = """{ // This is a JSON5 comment
"foo": "bar" /* this is a JSON5 block
comment that can span lines /*
"bacon": "eggs"
}
"""
>>> json5.loads(json_text)
{"foo": "bar", "bacon": "eggs"}
```

## Key features

- Supports the JSON5 spec
- Supports similar interfaces to stdlib `json` module
- Supports round-trip preservation of comments
- Tries to find _all_ syntax errors at once (instead of raising on the first error encountered)
