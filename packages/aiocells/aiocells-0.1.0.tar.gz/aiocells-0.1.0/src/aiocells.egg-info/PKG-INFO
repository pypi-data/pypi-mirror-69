Description: `aiocell` is a package that provides tools for synchronous and asynchronous
        execution of nodes in a dependency graph.
        
        ## Examples
        
        ### Hello world
        
        Here is the code for the [first demo](src/aiocells/demo_1.py).
        
        ```python
        #!/usr/bin/env python3
        
        import aiocells
        
        
        def hello_world():
            print("Hello, world!")
        
        
        def main():
            graph = aiocells.DependencyGraph()
        
            # The node can be any callable, in this case a function.
            graph.add_node(hello_world)
            aiocells.compute_sequential(graph)
        ```
        
        This is _synchronous_ graph computation. There is only one node in the graph.
        It is a function that prints a message. Synchronous nodes must be `callable`.
        
        ### Defining ordering constraints
        
        Here is [demo 4](src/aiocells/demo_4.py). It shows how edges between nodes
        are defined:
        
        
        ```python
        #!/usr/bin/env python3
        
        import time
        
        import aiocells
        
        
        def main():
            graph = aiocells.DependencyGraph()
        
            # 'add_node' always returns the node that has just been added, in this
            # case the lambda functions. We will use this below to define precedence
            # relationships
            print_sleeping = graph.add_node(lambda: print("Sleeping..."))
            sleep = graph.add_node(lambda: time.sleep(2))
            print_woke_up = graph.add_node(lambda: print("Woke up!"))
        
            print("Define the precedence relationships...")
            graph.add_precedence(print_sleeping, sleep)
            graph.add_precedence(sleep, print_woke_up)
        
            # Now, after we've defined the precedence relationships, we use the
            # simplest computer to compute the graph. The nodes will be called in
            # an order that is consistent with the precedence relationships.
            # Specifically, the nodes are executed in topological order.
            aiocells.compute_sequential(graph)
        ```
        
        In this case, there are three nodes. After the nodes are added, we define
        precedence relationships between them. When the graph is computed, it is
        done so in a way that honours the precedence relationships.
        
        ### Asynchronous nodes
        
        Below is the code for [demo_5](src/aiocells/demo_5.py). Note the use of
        `asyncio.sleep`, `functools.partial` and `aiocells.async_compute_sequential`.
        
        ```python
        #!/usr/bin/env python3
        
        import asyncio
        from functools import partial
        
        import aiocells
        
        # This example demonstrates graph nodes that are coroutines. We use
        # a different computer; one that know how to deal with coroutines.
        
        
        def main():
            graph = aiocells.DependencyGraph()
        
            # First, we add a lambda function
            before_sleep = graph.add_node(lambda: print("Sleeping..."))
        
            # Second, we create a coroutine function using functools.partial. This
            # is the closest we can get to a lambda for an async function
            sleep_2 = partial(asyncio.sleep, 2)
        
            # Finally, another lambda function
            wake_up = graph.add_node(lambda: print("Woke up!"))
        
            # Here, 'sleep' will implicitly be added to the graph because it is
            # part of the precedence relationship
            graph.add_precedence(before_sleep, sleep_2)
            graph.add_precedence(sleep_2, wake_up)
        
            # Here, we use the `async_compute_sequential`, which, like
            # `compute_sequential`, call the nodes in a topologically correct sequence.
            # However, whereas `compute_sequential` only supports vanilla callables,
            # `async_compute_sequential` additionally supports coroutine functions,
            # as defined by `inspect.iscoroutinefunction`. However, the execution is
            # still sequential. Each coroutine function is executed using 'await' and
            # must complete before the next node is executed. The function
            # `async_compute_sequential` is a coroutine and must be awaited.  Here,
            # we simply pass it to `asyncio.run`.
            asyncio.run(aiocells.async_compute_sequential(graph))
        ```
        
        ### Concurrent computation
        
        [demo 6](src/aiocells/demo_6.py) is a an example of graph that _could_ be
        computed concurrently but is not due to the use if `async_compute_sequential`.
        
        ```python
        import asyncio
        from functools import partial
        
        import aiocells
        
        
        def create_graph(stopwatch):
        
            graph = aiocells.DependencyGraph()
        
            # The method to start the stopwatch
            start_stopwatch = stopwatch.start
        
            # Two sleeps. Note that they are asyncio.sleep
            sleep_1 = partial(asyncio.sleep, 1)
            sleep_2 = partial(asyncio.sleep, 2)
        
            # The method to stop the stopwatch
            stop_stopwatch = stopwatch.stop
        
            # Start the stopwatch before the first sleep
            graph.add_precedence(start_stopwatch, sleep_1)
            # Stop the stopwatch after the first sleep
            graph.add_precedence(sleep_1, stop_stopwatch)
        
            # Start the stopwatch before the second sleep
            graph.add_precedence(start_stopwatch, sleep_2)
            # Stop the stopwatch after the second sleep
            graph.add_precedence(sleep_2, stop_stopwatch)
        
            # Note that there is no precedence relationship between the two
            # sleeps.
            return graph
        
        
        def main():
        
            stopwatch = aiocells.Stopwatch()
            graph = create_graph(stopwatch)
            # Even though the graph is a diamond (the sleeps do no depend on each
            # other and _could_ be executed concurrenty, `async_compute_sequential`
            # does not support concurrent execution. Thus, the execution time is
            # about 3 seconds, the sum of the two sleeps.
            print("Two async sleeps computed sequentially.")
            print("Total time should take about 3 seconds...")
            asyncio.run(aiocells.async_compute_sequential(graph))
            print("Computation with `async_compute_sequential` took"
                  f" {stopwatch.elapsed_time()}")
        ```
        
        [demo_7](src/aiocells/demo_7.py) is the same graph as above but computed
        concurrently with `async_compute_concurrent`.
        
        ```python
        #!/usr/bin/env python3
        
        import asyncio
        
        import aiocells
        import aiocells.demo_6 as demo_6
        
        
        def main():
            stopwatch = aiocells.Stopwatch()
            graph = demo_6.create_graph(stopwatch)
        
            # Here, we run the same graph as the previous demo but we use
            # 'async_compute_concurrent' which will run the two sleeps concurrently.
            # Thus, the execution time will be around 2 seconds, the maximum of
            # the two sleeps.
        
            print("Running previous demo's graph concurrently.")
            print("Total execution time should be about 2 seconds...")
            asyncio.run(aiocells.async_compute_concurrent(graph))
            print("Computation with `async_compute_concurrent` took"
                  f" {stopwatch.elapsed_time()}")
        
        ```
