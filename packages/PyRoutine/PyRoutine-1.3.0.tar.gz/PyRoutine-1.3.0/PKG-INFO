Description: # PyRoutine
        Install using ```pip install PyRoutine```
        
        A system to automate clicks on your device. Press alt+p to make that place a click point. Add as many
        click points as you wish. Once you are done, you should press alt+f. The system will then process the .json file and click. This may take up to a few minutes based on how many points you choose.
        Right now, this system can only do right clicks. More functionality is under development.
        
        Use:
        ```Python
        from PyRoutine import track, click
        track.get_input()
        click.autoclick(1)
        ```
        As Simple as that!
