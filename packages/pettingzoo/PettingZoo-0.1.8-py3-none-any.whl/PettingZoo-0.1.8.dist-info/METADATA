# PettingZoo
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/PettingZoo-Team/PettingZoo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/PettingZoo-Team/PettingZoo)

PettingZoo is a Python library for conducting research in multi-agent reinforcement learning. It's akin to a multi-agent version of OpenAI's Gym library.

We model environments as *Agent Environment Cycle* (AEC) games, in order to be able to support all types of multi-agent RL environments under one API.

## Environment Types and Installation

PettingZoo includes the following sets of games:

* atari: Multi-player Atari 2600 games (both cooperative and competitive)
* classic: Classical games including card games, board games, etc.
* gamma: Cooperative graphical games developed by us, requiring a high degree of coordination
* magent: Configurable environments with massive numbers of particle agents, originally from https://github.com/geek-ai/MAgent
* mpe: A set of simple nongraphical communication tasks, originally from https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs
* sisl: 3 cooperative environments, originally from https://github.com/sisl/MADRL

To install, use `pip install pettingzoo` 

We support Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8
