pysapphire is a python port of the Sapphire II stream cipher based on implementations found in CrossWire's [SWORD](http://www2.crosswire.org/sword/index.jsp) and [JSword](https://www.crosswire.org/jsword/), which are in turn based on a specification written by Michael Paul Johnson in 1995 and released to the public domain.
