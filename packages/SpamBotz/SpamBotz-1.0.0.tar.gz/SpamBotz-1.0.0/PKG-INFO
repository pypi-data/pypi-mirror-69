        ## Motivation
        
        This application was built to well, spam. 
        
        There is no real motivation behind building a spam bot but to simply annoy people.<br>
        Or at times even crash the application. 
        
        This application allows you to spam in variations, like : 
        - Spamming a fixed static message.
        - Spamming random words from a dictionary.
        - Sending sequences of numbers.
        - Randomly spamming large numbers.
        - Good old Rage spam, but this time without breaking your keyboard.
        
        ## Usage
        
        For the latest Stable version, go to <a href="https://github.com/SVijayB/Spam-Botz/releases">Releases</a>
        
        Extract the files and run `Spam_botz.py` file present in the `src` folder.
        
        As an alternative, you could also clone the repository using.
        <pre>
        git clone https://github.com/SVijayB/Spam-Botz.git
        </pre>
        
        **NOTE :** It is best to open your messaging window before launching `Spam_botz.py`.
        
        **NOTE :** Make sure your cursor is pointing to the correct text box after you set your preferences.
        You have only **15 Seconds** before the automation process begins.
        
        Sometimes you might get banned from the server for spamming too many messages in a short period. To avoid this,
        This application has a custom time delay feature. Make sure you enter the appropriate value.
