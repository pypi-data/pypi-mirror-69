Description: # epochis
        
        A CLI to convert offsets from epoch to human readable dates
        
        # Usage
        ```bash
        # Months since epoch
        $ epochis 604m
        2020-05
        
        # days since epoch
        $ epochis 18409d
        2020-05-26
        
        # seconds since epoch
        $ epochis 1590537600s
        2020-05-26 00:00:00
        
        # milliseconds since epoch
        $ epochis 1590537600ms
        2020-05-26 00:00:00.000
        ```
        
        ## Timezone support
        Right now all dates are in UTC. In the future timezones will be supported like this.
        ```
        $ epochis 604m PST
        2020-05 PST
        ```
        
        # Why doesn't this use third-party libraries?
        There are plenty of libraries to choose from for functionality such as CLI args parsing so why didn't I use them?
        This project is just for fun so why not? I like to practice by writing functionality from scratch.
        
        # Dev Notes
