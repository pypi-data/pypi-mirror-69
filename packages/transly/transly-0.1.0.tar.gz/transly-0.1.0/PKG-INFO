        Transly
        =======
        Transly is a Python library for dealing with transliteration. It currently supports Hindi to English and English to Hindi transliteration.
        Pre-trained models can be found inside trained_models folder. New models can also be trained on custom data.
        
        Installation
        ============
        Use the package manager `pip`_ to install transly
        
        .. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
            pip install transly
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        Hindi to English
        ================
        Using the pre-trained model
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import transly as tl
        
            QUERY = 'नहीं'
            a = tl.load_model(model_path='hi2en')
            a.infer(QUERY)
        
        
        English to Hindi
        ================
        Using the pre-trained model
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import transly as tl
        
            QUERY = 'NAHI'
            a = tl.load_model(model_path='en2hi')
            a.infer(QUERY)
        
        
        Training a new model on custom data
        Training data file should be a csv with two columns, the input and the output
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from transly.seq2seq.config import SConfig
            from transly.seq2seq.version0 import Seq2Seq
        
            config = SConfig(training_data_path=training_data_path)
            s2s = Seq2Seq(config)
            s2s.fit()
            s2s.save_model(path_to_model=model_path, model_file_name=model_file_name)
