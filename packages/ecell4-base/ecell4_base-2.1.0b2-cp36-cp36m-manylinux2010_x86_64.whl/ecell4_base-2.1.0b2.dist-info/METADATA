What is E-Cell System?
----------------------

E-Cell System is a software platform for modeling, simulation and analysis of complex, heterogeneous and multi-scale systems like a cell.

E-Cell4 accepts multi-algorithms, multi-timescales and multi-spatial-representations as its central feature.

Features
--------

- Single particle simulations, i.e. [The enhanced Green's Function Reaction Dynamics (eGFRD) method](http://gfrd.org), [Spatiocyte](http://spatiocyte.org) (a lattice-based method), and the Reaction Brownian Dynamics (RBD) method
- Ordinary differential equations, Gillespie algorithm (the direct method), and spatial Gillespie algorithm (the next subvolume method)
- Rule-based modeling
- Python programmable

Try online
----------

You can try this package online with Google Colaboratory.
Please refer to https://github.com/ecell/ecell4_docs

Quick start
-----------

Please refer to https://github.com/ecell/ecell4#quick-start

Installation
-------------

E-Cell4 does NOT support Python2 and Python3 32-bit.

`ecell4_base` package does NOT support `pip install` on Windows and Mac. Please use `conda` instead.

### Windows, Mac, Linux

Install Miniconda with Python 3.7 for **64-bit** (from https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
and run the following command in Terminal app. (On Windows, Start Menu -> Anaconda3 (64-bit) -> Anaconda Prompt or Anaconda Powershell Prompt)

conda install -c conda-forge ecell4
```

### Linux environment where you can NOT use conda (For example Google Colab)

We provide `ecell4_base` **wheel** package only for Linux.

(On Linux) You can install (or upgrade) `ecell4_base` and `ecell4` with

```
python3 -m pip install ecell4 -U
```

### If you need to compile ecell4_base by yourself
