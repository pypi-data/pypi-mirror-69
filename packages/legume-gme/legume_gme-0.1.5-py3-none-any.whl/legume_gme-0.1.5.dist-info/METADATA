legume (le GUided Mode Expansion) is a python implementation of the GME method for photonic crystal slabs, including multi-layer structures. Plane-wave expansion for purely 2D structures is also included. Also, we have an `autograd` backend that allows gradients of all output values with respect to all input parameters to be computed efficiently!

## Install

Easiest way:

```
pip install legume-gme
```

Alternatively, just `git clone` this repository, and make sure you have all the requirements installed.

## Documentation and examples

Go to our [documentation](https://legume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to find a number of [examples](https://legume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html), as well as a detailed [API reference](https://legume.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html).

The examples can also be found in ipython notebook form in `/docs/examples`.

Here's an example of a computation of the photonic bands of a photonic crystal, compared to Fig. 2(b) in Chapter 8 of the photonic crystal bible, [Molding the Flow of Light](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/book/).

<img src="https://github.com/fancompute/legume/blob/master/img/phc_bands.png" title="photonic_bands" alt="Quasi-TE bands of a photonic crystal slab">

We have only computed the quasi-TE modes of the slab (positive symmetry w.r.t. the plane bisecting the slab), which should be compared to the red lines in the figure on the right. The agreement is very good! And, the guided-mode expansion allows us to also compute the quasi-guided modes above light-line, together with their associated quality factor. These modes are typically hard to filter out in first-principle simulations, so `legume` is great for studying those. 

## Autograd

<img src="https://github.com/fancompute/legume/blob/master/img/cavity_opt.gif" title="cavity_opt" alt="Optimizing the quality factor of a photonic crystal cavity">

One exciting feature of `legume` is the `autograd` backend that can be used to automatically compute the gradient of the eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies with respect to any input parameters! In the optimization shown above, we tune the positions of the holes of a cavity in order to increase the quality factor. As is common in photonic crystal resonators, small modifications lead to tremendous improvement. The gradient of the quality factor with respect to the positions of **all** holes is computed in parallel using reverse-modeautomatic differentiation.
