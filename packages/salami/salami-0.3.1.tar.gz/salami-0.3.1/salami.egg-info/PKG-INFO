Description: 
        Salami: lightweight BSM NLO cross-sections, to go
        
        Absolute cross-sections for BSM processes are an essential component,
        along with analysis acceptances & efficiencies and collider luminosities,
        of signal event-yield predictions in particle collider experiments.
        Leading-order (LO) cross-sections can be calculated quickly, but next-to-LO
        ones are hundreds of times slower to calculate: too slow for use in
        large-scale parameter scan and fitting codes. Salami solves this problem
        by rapid prediction of pre-trained NLO cross-sections as functions of the
        SUSY/BSM spectrum.
        
        TODO:
         - More careful treatment of negative masses (implies phases, not simply a modulus)
