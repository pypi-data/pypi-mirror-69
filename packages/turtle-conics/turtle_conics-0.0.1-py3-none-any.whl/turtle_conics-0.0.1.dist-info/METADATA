Creating Conic Sections using Python Turtle
===================


We have created a Python package '**turtle_conics**'.Using this package, we can draw different curves like **Ellipse** ,**Parabola**, **Hyperbola** in Python Turtle in any orientation as you like. 
*THIS IS THE FIRST VERSION OF THE PACKAGE. * 

----------
FEATURES
--------------
>-*Simple function to create any of the above mentioned curves by importing functions from **curves** module specifying the arguments.* 
>-*Can be used inside Looping structures to create different patterns.*


Package Description
----------------------------

The '**turtle_conics**' package consists of  module '**all_curves**' with 3 functions to draw Ellipse, Parabola and Hyperbola.

--**ELLIPSE**

 **We can draw 2 types of ellipse**:-
 **- Major axis along X axis (a>b)**
 **- Major axis along Y axis (b>a)**
> 
**def ellipse(a, b, h= None, k= None, angle= None, angle_unit= None)**
> - **a**:-It is the half-length of major axis of ellipse if (a>b) else half-length of minor axis when(b>a).
> - **b**:-It is the half-length of major axis of ellipse if (b>a) else half-length of minor axis when (a>b).
> - **h,k**:-(Optional) For drawing ellipses with **center (h,k)**.By default both are **zero**.
> -**angle**(Optional) By providing the angle we can draw elliptical arcs upto that specific angle.By default **angle** is set to **360** degrees.
> -**angle_unit**(Optional) The argument for **angle** can be in **degrees** or  **radians**. By default it is set to **'d'**.
**NOTE:-** For  **angle_units** specify argument as **'d'** or **'r'**


--**Parabola**

 **We can draw 4 types of parabola:-**
 **-Parabola along +ve X axis**
 **-Parabola along -ve X axis**
 **-Parabola along +ve Y axis**
**-Parabola along -ve Y axis**
> 
**def parabola(a, t, orientation, h=None, k=None)**
> - **a**:- It is the distance from the origin to the focus of parabola.
> - **t**:- It is a parameter of a parabola.Used to define the curvature of parabola.Value of **t** should be greater than **zero**.
> -**orientation**:-Takes argument as **'x'** or **'y'** for drawing parabola along X axis or Y axis.
> - **h,k**:-(Optional) For drawing parabola with **vertex at (h,k)**.By default both are **zero**.
> -**NOTE:- For drawing Parabola along  Negative  Axes pass Negative value for  'a' **.  

--**Hyperbola**

**We can draw 2 types of Hyperbola:-**
**-Transverse axis ie hyperbola along X axis(a>b)**
**-Transverse axis ie hyperbola along Y axis(b>a)**

> **def hyperbola(a, b, h=None, k=None)**
> -**a** :-It represents the distance from the vertex to the center of hyperbola when (a>b) else it represents the distance perpendicular to the transverse axis from the vertex to the asymptote line when (b>a).
> - **b**:-It represents the distance from the vertex to the center of hyperbola when (b>a) else it represents the distance perpendicular to the transverse axis from the vertex to the asymptote line when (a>b).
> - **h,k**:-(Optional) For drawing hyperbola with **center (h,k)**.By default both are **zero**.
> -**NOTE:-For drawing Hyperbola along X axis enter values for 'a' and 'b' such that (a>b) else for drawing hyperbola along Y axis put (b>a) .**
