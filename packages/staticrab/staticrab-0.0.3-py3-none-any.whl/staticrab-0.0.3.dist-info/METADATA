# staticrab

A library for fast calculation of various correlation measures. The API is described in the [documentation](https://staticrab.readthedocs.io/).

The goal of this mini library is not to replace [Scipy stack](https://www.scipy.org/), [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) nor [PyMC3](https://docs.pymc.io/) but rather to complement them.

## Main features
So far, this library implements only one function and that is the fast(ish) calculation of Chatterjee's correlation coefficient.

### Chatterjee's correlation coefficient
Chatterjee's correlation coefficient (also called Chatterjee's xi) is a recently proposed correlation coeffient that can be used for testing of nonlinear functional relationships between two variables (viz [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10140)).


## Notes

It requires to have installed the `staticrab-backend` installed.

```
pip install staticrab-backend
```
