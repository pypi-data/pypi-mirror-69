Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The IETF_ uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it
        publishes as RFCs_, and for the draft documents which are produced when
        developing documents for publications.  There exists a number of different
        tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the
        existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them.  It takes as input
        an xml file which contains the text and meta-information about author names
        etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output.  The input xml file
        should follow the grammars in RFC7749_ (for v2 documents) or RFC7991_ (for 
        v3 documents). Note that the grammar for v3 is still being refined, and 
        changes will eventually be captured in the `bis draft for 7991`_. 
        Changes not yet captured can be seen in the xml2rfc source `v3.rng`_.
        
        **xml2rfc** provides a variety of output formats. See the command line
        help for a full list of formats. It also provides conversion from v2 to
        v3, and can run the preptool_ on its input.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Installation of the python package is done as usual with 'pip install xml2rfc',
        using appropriate switches and/or sudo.
        
        Installation of support libraries for the PDF-formatter
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        In order to generate PDFs, xml2rfc uses the WeasyPrint module, which
        depends on external libaries that must be installed as native packages
        on your platform, separately from the xml2rfc install.
        
        First, install the Cairo, Pango, and GDK-PixBuf library files on your
        system.  See installation instructions on the WeasyPrint Docs:
        
            https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html
        
        (Python 3 is not needed if your system Python is 2.7, though).
        
        (On some OS X systems with System Integrity Protection active, you may
        need to create a symlink from your home directory to the library installation
        directory (often /opt/local/lib):
        
            ln -s /opt/local/lib ~/lib
        
        in order for weasyprint to find the installed cairo and pango libraries.
        Whether this is needed or not depends on whether you used macports or homebrew
        to install cairo and pango, and the homebrew / macport version.)
        
        Next, install the pycairo and weasyprint python modules using pip.
        Depending on your system, you may need to use 'sudo' or install in
        user-specific directories, using the --user switch.  On OS X in
        particular, you may also need to install a newer version of setuptools
        using --user before weasyprint can be installed.  If you install with 
        the --user switch, you may need to also set PYTHONPATH, e.g.,
        
            PYTHONPATH=/Users/henrik/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
        
        for Python 2.7.
        
        The basic pip commands (modify as needed according to the text above)
        are:
        
            pip install 'pycairo>=1.18' 'weasyprint<=0.42.3'
        
        With these installed and available to xml2rfc, the --pdf switch will be
        enabled.
        
        For PDF output, you also need to install the Noto font set.  Download the full
        set from https://noto-website-2.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/Noto-unhinted.zip,
        and install as appropriate for your platform.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        xml2rfc accepts a single XML document as input and outputs to one or more conversion formats.
        
        **Basic Usage**: ``xml2rfc SOURCE [options] FORMATS...``
        
        Run ``xml2rfc --help`` for a full listing of command-line options.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        Version 2.45.0 (27 May 2020)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Fixed the html rendering of <cref> with display=false.
            Fixes issue #516.
        
          * Fixed the text rendering of <cref> with display=false.
            Fixes issue #515.
        
          * Fixed an error in postal address rendering for Sweden.
            Fixes issue #520.
        
          * Changed the internals of the text formatter to retain <br> information 
            for longer internally, in order to make <br> have effect in for instance 
            <dd> and <td> element text.  Fixes issues #508 and #513.
        
          * Fixed erroneous indentation of first line of second and following 
            paragraphs of multi-paragraph <dd> elements, and changed code to retain 
            <br> in filled text.
        
          * Added a font-family setting for @page in PDF mode, and added code to 
            warn about missing Roboto Mono fonts if the python-fontconfig package
            is available
        
          * Added instructions for RobotoMono to the installation help for the 
            --pdf switch.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.44.0 (22 Apr 2020)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added an '--unprep' switch and formatter to undo changes made by
            '--prep' which make a file unsuitable for continued editing.  This
            will help the RPC when the .xml file received from draft authors for
            an upcoming RFC is in 'prepped' format.
        
          * Updated the v3 --expand formatter to expand external sourcecode and 
            artwork, in addition to handling XIncludes.  This should make it
            possible to produce single consolidated .xml files without using
            the --prep workaround.
        
          * Did some refactoring, moving the dispatch method that calls processing 
            methods based on XPath expressions, and some other generic methods, into 
            the V3 formatter base class.
        
          * Moved slugify() function, used in several writers, from v2v3 to 
            utils.py.
        
          * Did a minor CSS tweak to improve orphan/widow handling of <dl> elements.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.43.0 (14 Apr 2020)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Added a workaround for weasyprint's extreme unwillingness to break 
            between <dd> and <dt>, which looks like a bug.  Fixes issue #514.
        
          * Fixed a discrepancy in address handling between text and html output.  
            Fixes issue #509
        
          * Added more flexible text formatter handling of orphans and widows, and
            changed the default orphans/widows setting to 2 (matching the default
            CSS setting).
        
          * Changed the CSS to not page break before the ToC, support
            keepWithPrevious, and deal better with how some artwork, figures and
            tables break across pages. Fixes issue #511.
        
          * Changed the keepWithNext handling for the generated ToC to group the
            first 3 lines together, to avoid one-line orphans when page-breaking
            the ToC.  Also fixed some pyflakes issues with regex strings.
        
          * Added text formatter support for 'keepWithPrevious', even if the
            preptool generally converts 'keepWithPrevious' to 'keepWithNext' on
            the previous element.
        
          * Added setting '.keepWithPrevious' on html elements when set on the
            precursor xml element.
        
          * Added v2v3 converter code to set 'keepWithNext' and 'keepWithPrevious'
            when converting <preamble> and <postamble> elements to <t> elements,
            to keep the grouping.
        
          * Added code to the command-line runner to set some option default values
            that don't have matchinb command-line switches.
        
          * Added default settings for orphans and widows during text rendering.
        
          * Reduced the CSS font-family for body to only Noto Serif.  Addresses
            issue #500.
