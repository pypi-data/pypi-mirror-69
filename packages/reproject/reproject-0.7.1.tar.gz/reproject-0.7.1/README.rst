About
=====

The 'reproject' package is a Python package to reproject astronomical
images using various techniques via a uniform interface. By
*reprojection*, we mean the re-gridding of images from one world
coordinate system to another (for example changing the pixel resolution,
orientation, coordinate system). Currently, we have implemented
reprojection of celestial images by interpolation (like
`SWARP <http://www.astromatic.net/software/swarp>`__), as well as by
finding the exact overlap between pixels on the celestial sphere (like
`Montage <http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html>`__). It can also
reproject to/from HEALPIX projections by relying on the
`astropy-healpix <https://github.com/astropy/astropy-healpix>`__
package.

For more information, including on how to install the package, see
