**********************************
Regular celestial images and cubes
**********************************

One of the most common types of data to reproject are celestial images or
n-dimensional data (such as spectral cubes) where two of the axes are
celestial. There are several existing algorithms that can be used to
reproject such data:

* **Interpolation** (such as nearest-neighbor, bilinear, biquadratic
  interpolation and so on). This is the fastest algorithm and is suited to
  common use cases, but it is important to note that it is not flux
  conserving, and will not return optimal results if the input and output
  pixel sizes are very different.

* **Drizzling**, which consists of determining the exact overlap fraction of
  pixels, and optionally allows pixels to be rescaled before reprojection.
  A description of the algorithm can be found in
  `Fruchter and Hook (2002) <http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/338393>`__. This
  method is more accurate than interpolation but is only suitable for images
  where the field of view is small so that pixels are well approximated by
  rectangles in world coordinates. This is slower but more accurate than
  interpolation for small fields of view.

* **Adaptive resampling**, where care is taken to deal with differing
  resolutions more accurately than in simple interpolation, as described
  in `DeForest (2004) <https://doi.org/10.1023/B:SOLA.0000021743.24248.b0>`_.
  This is more accurate than interpolation, especially when the input and
  output resolutions differ, or when there are strong distortions, for example
  for large areas of the sky or when reprojecting images that include the
  solar limb.

* Computing the **exact overlap** of pixels on the sky by treating them as
  **four-sided spherical polygons** on the sky and computing spherical polygon
  intersection. This is essentially an exact form of drizzling, and should be
  appropriate for any field of view. However, this comes at
  a significant performance cost. This is the `algorithm used by the Montage
  package <http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/algorithms.html>`_, and we have
  implemented it here using the same core algorithm. Note that this is only
  suitable for data being reprojected between spherical celestial coordinates on
  the sky that share the same origin (that is, it cannot be used to reproject
  from coordinates on the sky to coordinates on the surface of a spherical
  body).

Currently, this package implements interpolation, adaptive resampling, and
spherical polygon intersection.

.. note:: The reprojection/resampling is always done assuming that the image is in
          **surface brightness units**. For example, if you have an image
          with a constant value of 1, reprojecting the image to an image with
          twice as high resolution will result in an image where all pixels
          are all 1. This limitation is due to the interpolation algorithms
          (the fact that interpolation can be used implicitly assumes that
          the pixel values can be interpolated which is only the case with
          surface brightness units). If you have an image in flux units,
          first convert it to surface brightness, then use the functions
          described below. In future, we will provide a convenience function
          to return the area of all the pixels to make it easier.

.. _common:

Common options
==============

All of the reprojection algorithms implemented in *reproject* are available
as functions named as ``reproject_<algorithm>``, e.g.
:func:`~reproject.reproject_interp`, :func:`~reproject.reproject_adaptive`,
and :func:`~reproject.reproject_exact`. These can be imported from the top-level
of the package, e.g.::

    >>> from reproject import reproject_interp
    >>> from reproject import reproject_adaptive
    >>> from reproject import reproject_exact

All functions share a common set of arguments, as well as including
algorithm-dependent arguments. In this section, we take a look at the common
arguments.

The reprojection functions take two main arguments. The first argument is the
image to reproject, together with WCS information about the image. This can be
either:

* The name of a FITS file
* An :class:`~astropy.io.fits.HDUList` object
* An image HDU object such as a :class:`~astropy.io.fits.PrimaryHDU`,
  :class:`~astropy.io.fits.ImageHDU`, or
  :class:`~astropy.io.fits.CompImageHDU` instance
* A tuple where the first element is a :class:`~numpy.ndarray` and the
  second element is either a :class:`~astropy.wcs.WCS` or a
  :class:`~astropy.io.fits.Header` object

In the case of a FITS file or an :class:`~astropy.io.fits.HDUList` object, if
there is more than one Header-Data Unit (HDU), the ``hdu_in`` keyword argument
is also required and should be set to the ID or the name of the HDU to use.

The second argument is the WCS information for the output image, which should be
specified either as a :class:`~astropy.wcs.WCS` or a
:class:`~astropy.io.fits.Header` instance. If this is specified as a
:class:`~astropy.wcs.WCS` instance, the ``shape_out`` keyword argument should
also be specified, and be given the shape of the output image using the Numpy
``(ny, nx)`` convention (this is because :class:`~astropy.wcs.WCS`, unlike
:class:`~astropy.io.fits.Header`, does not contain information about image
size).

As an example, we start off by opening a FITS file using Astropy::

    >>> from astropy.io import fits
    >>> hdu = fits.open('http://data.astropy.org/galactic_center/gc_msx_e.fits')[0]    # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    Downloading http://data.astropy.org/galactic_center/gc_msx_e.fits [Done]

The image is currently using a Plate CarÃ©e projection::

    >>> hdu.header['CTYPE1']   # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    'GLON-CAR'

We can create a new header using a Gnomonic projection::

    >>> new_header = hdu.header.copy()   # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    >>> new_header['CTYPE1'] = 'GLON-TAN'   # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA
    >>> new_header['CTYPE2'] = 'GLAT-TAN'   # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA

And finally we can call the :func:`~reproject.reproject_interp` function to reproject
the image using interpolation::

    >>> from reproject import reproject_interp
    >>> new_image, footprint = reproject_interp(hdu, new_header)   # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA

The reprojection functions return two arrays - the first is the reprojected
input image, and the second is a 'footprint' array which shows the fraction of
overlap of the input image on the output image grid. This footprint is 0 for
output pixels that fall outside the input image, 1 for output pixels that fall
inside the input image. For more information about footprint arrays, see the
:doc:`footprints` section. To return only the main array and not the footprint,
you can set ``return_footprint=False``.

We can then easily write out the reprojected image to a new FITS file::

    >>> fits.writeto('reprojected_image.fits', new_image, new_header)   # doctest: +REMOTE_DATA

.. _interpolation:

Interpolation
=============

The :func:`~reproject.reproject_interp` function can be used to carry out
reprojection implemented using simple interpolation::

    >>> from reproject import reproject_interp

In addition to the arguments described in :ref:`common`, the order of the
interpolation can be controlled by setting the ``order=`` argument to either an
integer or a string giving the order of the interpolation. Supported strings
include:

* ``'nearest-neighbor'``: zeroth order interpolation
* ``'bilinear'``: fisst order interpolation
* ``'biquadratic'``: second order interpolation
* ``'bicubic'``: third order interpolation

Adaptive resampling
===================

The :func:`~reproject.reproject_adaptive` function can be used to carry out
reprojection using the  `DeForest (2004)
<https://doi.org/10.1023/B:SOLA.0000021743.24248.b0>`_ algorithm::

    >>> from reproject import reproject_adaptive

In addition to the arguments described in :ref:`common`, the order of the
interpolation to use when sampling values in the input map can be controlled by
setting the ``order=`` argument to either an integer or a string giving the
order of the interpolation. Supported strings include:

* ``'nearest-neighbor'``: zeroth order interpolation
* ``'bilinear'``: first order interpolation

Broadly speaking, the algorithm works by approximating the
footprint of each output pixel by an elliptical shape in the input image
which is stretched and rotated by the transformation, then finding the
weighted average of samples inside that ellipse, where the weight is 1
at the center of the ellipse, and 0 at the side, and the shape of the
weight function is given by an analytical distribution (currently we use
a Hann function).

To illustrate the benefits of this method, we consider a simple case
where the reprojection includes a large change in resoluton. We choose
to use an artificial data example to better illustrate the differences:

.. plot::
   :include-source:

    import numpy as np
    from astropy.wcs import WCS
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from reproject import reproject_interp, reproject_adaptive

    # Set up initial array with pattern
    input_array = np.zeros((256, 256))
    input_array[::20, :] = 1
    input_array[:, ::20] = 1
    input_array[10::20, 10::20] = 1

    # Define a simple input WCS
    input_wcs = WCS(naxis=2)
    input_wcs.wcs.crpix = 128.5, 128.5
    input_wcs.wcs.cdelt = -0.01, 0.01

    # Define a lower resolution output WCS with rotation
    output_wcs = WCS(naxis=2)
    output_wcs.wcs.crpix = 30.5, 30.5
    output_wcs.wcs.cdelt = -0.0427, 0.0427
    output_wcs.wcs.pc = [[0.8, 0.2], [-0.2, 0.8]]

    # Reproject using interpolation and adaptive resampling
    result_interp, _ = reproject_interp((input_array, input_wcs),
                                        output_wcs, shape_out=(60, 60))
    result_deforest, _ = reproject_adaptive((input_array, input_wcs),
                                            output_wcs, shape_out=(60, 60))

    plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
    plt.imshow(input_array, origin='lower', vmin=0, vmax=1, interpolation='hanning')
    plt.tick_params(left=False, bottom=False, labelleft=False, labelbottom=False)
    plt.title('Input array')
    plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
    plt.imshow(result_interp, origin='lower', vmin=0, vmax=1)
    plt.tick_params(left=False, bottom=False, labelleft=False, labelbottom=False)
    plt.title('reproject_interp')
    plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
    plt.imshow(result_deforest, origin='lower', vmin=0, vmax=0.5)
    plt.tick_params(left=False, bottom=False, labelleft=False, labelbottom=False)
    plt.title('reproject_adaptive')

In the case of interpolation, the output accuracy is poor because for each output
pixel we interpolate a single position in the input array, which means that either
that position falls inside a region where the flux is zero or one, and this is
very sensitive to aliasing effects. For the adaptive resampling, each output pixel
is formed from the weighted average of several pixels in the input, and all input
pixels should contribute to the output, with no gaps.

Spherical Polygon Intersection
==============================

The :func:`~reproject.reproject_exact` function can be used to carry out 'exact'
reprojection using the spherical polygon intersection of input and output pixels::

    >>> from reproject import reproject_exact

In addition to the arguments described in :ref:`common`, an optional
``parallel=`` option can be used to control whether to parallelize the
reprojection, and if so how many cores to use (see
:func:`~reproject.reproject_exact` for more details). For this algorithm, the
footprint array returned gives the exact fractional overlap of new pixels with
the original image (see :doc:`footprints` for more details).

.. warning:: The :func:`~reproject.reproject_exact` is currently known to
             have precision issues for images with resolutions <0.05". For
             now it is therefore best to avoid using it with such images.

Very large datasets
===================

If you have a very large dataset to reproject, i.e., any normal IFU or radio
spectral cube with many individual spectral channels - you may not be able to
hold two copies of the dataset in memory.  In this case, you can specify an
output memory mapped array to store the data. For now this only works with the
interpolation reprojection methods.

.. doctest-skip::

    >>> outhdr = fits.Header.fromtextfile('cube_header_gal.hdr')
    >>> shape = (outhdr['NAXIS3'], outhdr['NAXIS2'], outhdr['NAXIS1'])
    >>> outarray = np.memmap(filename='output.np', mode='w+', shape=shape, dtype='float32')
    >>> hdu = fits.open('cube_file.fits')
    >>> rslt = reproject.reproject_interp(hdu, outhdr, output_array=outarray,
    ...                                   return_footprint=False,
    ...                                   independent_celestial_slices=True)
    >>> newhdu = fits.PrimaryHDU(data=outarray, header=outhdr)
    >>> newhdu.writeto('new_cube_file.fits')

Or if you're dealing with FITS files, you can skip the numpy memmap step and use `FITS large file creation
<http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/generated/examples/io/skip_create-large-fits.html>`_.

.. doctest-skip::

    >>> outhdr = fits.Header.fromtextfile('cube_header_gal.hdr')
    >>> outhdr.tofile('new_cube.fits')
    >>> shape = tuple(outhdr['NAXIS{0}'.format(ii)] for ii in range(1, outhdr['NAXIS']+1))
    >>> with open('new_cube.fits', 'rb+') as fobj:
    >>>     fobj.seek(len(outhdr.tostring()) + (np.product(shape) * np.abs(outhdr['BITPIX']//8)) - 1)
    >>>     fobj.write(b'\0')
    >>> outhdu = fits.open('new_cube.fits', mode='update')
    >>> rslt = reproject.reproject_interp(hdu, outhdr, output_array=outhdu[0].data,
    ...                                   return_footprint=False,
    ...                                   independent_celestial_slices=True)
    >>> outhdu.flush()
