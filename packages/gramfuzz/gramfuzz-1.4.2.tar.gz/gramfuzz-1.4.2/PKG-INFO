Description: 
        gramfuzz is a python-based grammar fuzzer that is ideally
        suited for complex text and binary grammars.
        
        A few of the main features of gramfuzz are:
        
        * dynamic modification of grammars during runtime (and generation!)
        * random rule generation
        * separate rule definition categories
        * probability-based fuzzing/generation
        * targeted grammar category fuzzing
        * loading grammar files (python) by path
        * and more!
