OneIoT
======

An open source platform for IoT development
*Maintained by Louis Irwin*

OneIoT is a platform for the **rapid development of DIY IoT devices**.
Just as the `Arduino <https://arduino.cc>`_ did for microprocessors, and the `Raspberry Pi <https://raspberrypi.org>`_ did for single board computers, OneIoT is designed to make the Internet of Things accessible for the average tinkerer.
