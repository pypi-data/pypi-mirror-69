    """This is the main entry point of a recline-based application. Call this after
    all of your commands have been defined.

    This will start the application in its REPL mode (by default) or in a single
    command mode if the first argv to is set to '-c'. If in REPL mode, this function
    will not return until the user quits the application.

    Args:
        argv: This is a list of arguments that usually comes from the command line.
            This will default to sys.argv[1:] but may be overridden if needed.
        program_name: If provided, this will be the name of the program (used
            internally for display purposes). If not provided, sys.argv[0] will
            be used as a default (the name of the script file, e.g. hello.py).
        motd: If provided, this will be displayed to the user before the prompt.
            If it is a string, it will be displayed as given. If it is a callable,
            then the result will be displayed to the user.
        history_file: If peristent command history is desired, a file name may
            be passed where a list of the most recent commands will be kept and
            loaded from.
        prompt: This is the prompt to display to the user to let them know that
            the system is ready to accept a command. If not provided, a default
            will be used.
        repl_mode: By default, applications using recline expect to act as a REPL
            environment where the user will run many commands. These applications
            can still run a single command if the user passes a -c. But, it is
            convienent for some applications to act more like a traditional CLI
            command without needing to pass -c. For those applicatinos, repl_mode
            can be set to False.
        single_command: This acts a bit like non-repl mode, except in this case
            the user doesn't have to pass any command name as an argument to the
            application, but rather whatever command name is passed here is automatically
            run and the application exits when the command is complete. If an
            application only had one command, such as an implementation of ls in
            Python, then this would be a good choice for exposing that command easily.
