A Choices type allows the CLI command writer to specify a static list of choices
for a parameter. Once the body of the function is invoked, it is guarenteed that
the validation was done on the parameter to make sure it matched one.

        """A `recline.commands.types.Choices` is a way to assert that an argument
        is one of a predefined list.

        Prior to being passed to your command, the argument will be compared to
        the list of defined choices. If it does not match one, an error will be
        printed.

        Args:
            available_choices: The list of allowable values for the argument or
                a callable that will return a list.
            cache_choices: If the available_choices argument was a callable, by
                default it will be called each time the list of choices needs to
                be rendered. But if that callable is expensive, that may not be
                desirable. In that case, passing cache_choices as True will call
                the available_choices function only once to get the list and save
                the result.
            inexact: If set to True, allow the value being validated to contain
                the "*", "|", or ".." query characters. If these characters are
                present, then no validation will be done on the value (and validation
                is assumed to be done on whatever the command is calling)
