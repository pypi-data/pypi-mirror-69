        **Django-CMS Layouter** is a plugin for **Django CMS** which aims to provide a grid system for authors and editors
        with a high ease of use and comprehensibility. It is leveraging `Bootstrap <http://getbootstrap.com/>`_ (version 3 and 4 supported) as it
        is a very popular framework to create responsive websites.

        Documentation
        =============
        
        Please feel free to contribute and help us to improve **Django-CMS Layouter**.
        
        Installation and Configuration
        ------------------------------
        
        **Django-CMS Layouter** supports Django-CMS>=3.4. It may work with any older version.
        
        * Install via pip: ``pip install djangocms-layouter``.
        * Add ``layouter`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
        * Add ``url(r'^layouter/', include('layouter.urls', namespace='layouter'), )`` to your url config
        * Run migrations: ``python manage.py migrate layouter``.
        * Set the setting ``LAYOUTER_BOOTSTRAP_VERSION`` to 3 or 4.
        * Done.
        
        Please note: Migrations are generated each release. If you checkout the current state of development
        migrations might be missing.
        
        **Static files**
        
        The required CSS and JavaScript files are added to the sekizai blocks ``css`` and ``js``. If you don't use these blocks, you need to manually add the static files:
        
        - ``layouter/css/layouter.css``
        - ``layouter/js/layouter.js``
        
        Both are only required when the toolbar is in ``edit_mode``.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        These are the core features of **Django-CMS Layouter**:
        
        * Flat tree in structure mode
        * Automatic arrangement of columns, for different screen sizes
        * Warning, due to too many plugins, in structure mode
        * Optional equal height for columns (uses CSS3 flexbox)
        * Toggle grid - show and hide grid in content mode
        
        Migrating to Django>=2
        ----------------------
        
        There is not much you need to do. Just run update and ``python manage.py migrate``.
        
        
        ToDo's
        ------
        
        No software is perfect, everyone's code sucks. Feel free to suggest, criticize and/or contribute.
        
        **Dynamic Warning Updates** - Dragging and Dropping in the structure view does not update the warnings within the
        plugin.
        
        **Add support for Divio Cloud** - Adding support for the Divio Cloud, so that the Layouter is installable via
        Divio Cloud control panel.
        
        **Author / Editor Documentation** - IMHO this is one of the things Django-CMS lacks. We need more and better resources
        for authors and editors. Not only for Django-CMS, this plugin needs it to, for sure.
        
        **Advanced Mode** - Not completely sure what it should look like. The current implementation is very limited
        when it comes to adapting columns for different screen sizes or using more than 4 columns. It currently is completely
        defined by this plugin, which can be good, but does not have to be. Some users want the plugin to take care, others want
        to control the behaviour themselves.
        
        **Tests** - There should be something like casper.js tests, maybe there is something better.
