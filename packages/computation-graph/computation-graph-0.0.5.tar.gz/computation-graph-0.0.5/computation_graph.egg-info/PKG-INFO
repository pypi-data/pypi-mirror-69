Description: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/hyroai/computation-graph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/hyroai/computation-graph)
        
        A functional composition framework that supports:
        1. State - functions which retain state for their next turn of action.
        2. Ambiguity - non deterministic composition with priorities.
        3. Injection of compositions into long pipelines (deep dependency injection).
        4. Non cancerous asyncio support (planned).
        
        `pip install computation-graph`
        
        To deploy: `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel; twine upload dist/*; rm -rf dist/;`
