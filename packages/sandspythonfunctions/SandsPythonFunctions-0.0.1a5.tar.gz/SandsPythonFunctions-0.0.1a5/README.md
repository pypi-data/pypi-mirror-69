# Sands Python Functions

Some functions I find useful regularly and I put them all into one package for easy access

I created this using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

## Instructions

- To build this you must first install poetry see instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- However to make it easy to access this is all of the code you'll need on linux to make this run (note that I use zsh not bash for my shell)

```zsh
TODO:
```

## Basic Usage Example

## Testing

Pytest runs in whatever directory you're located in at the time you run pytest so if you're not in the directory of the test scripts pytest will not see the files it needs to and will then fail.
