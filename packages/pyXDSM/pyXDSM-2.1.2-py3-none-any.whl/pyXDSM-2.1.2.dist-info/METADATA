A python library for generating publication quality PDF XDSM diagrams.
This library is a thin wrapper that uses the TikZ library and LaTeX to build the PDFs.

 ## What is XDSM?
The eXtended Design Struture Matrix (XDSM) is a graphical language for describing the movement of data and  the execution sequence for a  multidisciplinary optimization  problem.
You can read the [paper by Lambe and Martins](http://mdolab.engin.umich.edu/content/extensions-design-structure-matrix) for all the details.
