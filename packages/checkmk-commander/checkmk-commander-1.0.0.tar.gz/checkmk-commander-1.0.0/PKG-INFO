Description: Check Commander
        ===============
        
        Checkmk Commander, or Check Commander, efficient Curses interface for Checkmk, <https://checkmk.com/>.
        
        ![Logo](https://gitlab.com/larsfp/checkmk-commander/-/raw/master/images/logo_256.png)
        
        The goal is not to completely avoid the web interface, but to speed up common day-to-day tasks. Actions like acknowledge, downtime, reinventorize can be done in seconds, with keyboard only. Overview is clean and simple.
        
        Beta quality. Can be used. Report bugs! Some features may behave weirdly, but won't eat your data.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        From PIP:
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install checkmk-commander
        ```
        
        Run command: chkcom
        
        (Additional functionality requires python module cliboard, webbrowser)
        
        Hot-keys
        --------
        
        Press ? in app to get an overview.
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        You will be asked for configuration details on first run, and a config will be created at ~/.config/check-commander.ini
        
        Additionaly, you can add:
        
        ```
        url_w = http://wiki.example.com/?q=HOSTNAME
        ```
        
        This will let you hit "w" in list view to open that host in your wiki (or any other site). HOSTNAME will be replaced with current selected host.
        
        Implementation details and limitations
        --------------------------------------
        
        Uses CheckMK's web API. You need a "machine" account with a secret. A normal user won't work.

        * Improve readability, colors.
        * Find down time for down-alerts.
        * Fetch host comments for down hosts.
        * Status bar at bottom could be replaced by a scrolling textview with "Host- and Service events"?
        * Icon, desktop integration.
        * I can only assume syslog is os dependent.
        * Write more unit tests
        * Change URLs to be an object, for testing and safer handling.
