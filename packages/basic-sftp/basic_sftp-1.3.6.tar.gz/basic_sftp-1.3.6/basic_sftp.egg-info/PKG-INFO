        ==========
        
        
        This projects creates a basic sftp connection that allows you to send any document to a digital 
        ocean server that I have set up. To install this project simply ~pip install basic-sftp~ It will install everything needed to run
        the program. Once install you can use SFTP to transfer any file to any server if you have the correct
        credentials.
