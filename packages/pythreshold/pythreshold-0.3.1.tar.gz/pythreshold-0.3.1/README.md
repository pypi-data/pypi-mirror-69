# PyThreshold

**PyThreshold** is a python package featuring Numpy/Scipy implementations of state-of-the-art image thresholding algorithms.

## Installing

**PyThreshold** can be easily installed by typing the following command

    pip install pythreshold

## Usage

    from pythreshold.utils import test_thresholds
    from scipy.misc import ascent

    # Testing all the included thresholding algorithms
    test_thresholds()

    # Testing all the included thresholding algorithms using a custom image
    img = ascent()
    test_thresholds(img)

Or just type in a terminal:

    pythreshold -i /path/to/input/image -o /output/directory/for/thresholded/images
