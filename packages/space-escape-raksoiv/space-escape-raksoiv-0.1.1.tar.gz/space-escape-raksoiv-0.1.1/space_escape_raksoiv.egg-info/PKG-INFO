Description: # Espace Escape
        
        Space Escape is a 2D endless scroll game in which a spaceship will travel across an asteroid field. The player has the mission of control the space ship and avoid any danger that can impact the craft.
        
        ## Starting Idea
        
        This game starts from a tutorial of pygame https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/. In this tutorial, the student is encouraged to program a game about an airplane that needs to avoid rockets incoming. The first result of the game was precisely a spaceship that avoids asteroids, the change in the sprites of the game was due to a subscription to download the art pack.
        So I take the sprites and arts from: https://opengameart.org/content/space-shooter-redux.
        
        ## A playable game
        
        After the first success of a piece of code than can represent a game, the idea of doing this game playable was increasing in time. So I take the journey, from one script to a total game, starting from the menu of the game and give a player a score for his efforts to go across the field.
