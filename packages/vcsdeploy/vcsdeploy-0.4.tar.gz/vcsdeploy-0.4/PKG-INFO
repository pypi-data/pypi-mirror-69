        vcsdeploy
        ==========
        
        Easily deploy your applications through your VCS
        =================================================
        
        ``vcsdeploy`` allows you to easily deploy updates of your application to your
        customers through your favorite Version Control System.  So far, only
        mercurial is supported, but it should be very easy to add support for
        additional VCSs.
        
        The idea is that the application is installed by cloning the repository.
        Every version of the application is represented as a Mercurial ``tag``: when
        ``vcsdeploy`` runs, it pulls changes from the designed remote repository, and
        it displays a window showing all the available versions.  The user can then
        select the appropriate version and update the application to it.
        
        
        Example of usage
        ----------------
        
        Suppose your application ``myapp`` is installed in ``c:\\myapp``.  You need to
        write a basic config file, say ``myapp-config.py``::
        
            class Config(object):
                path = 'c:\\myapp'
                version_regex = '^Version'
        
        
        ``path`` contains the local repository which contains the application.  The
        repository must be configured in a way that ``hg pull`` pulls the remote
        repository without asking the user for any password, e.g. by using the ``ssh``
        protocol or by `storing the http password`_.
        
        .. _`storing the http password`: http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/FAQ#FAQ.2BAC8-CommonProblems.How_can_I_store_my_HTTP_login_once_and_for_all_.3F
        
        ``version_regex`` is a regular expression which is tested against all the tags
        found in the repository, to make sure that the user will see only the tags
        that start with ``Version``.  This way, we can still use Mercurial tags for
        internal development reasons, without cluttering what is displayed to the
        final user.
        
        Then, we just need to launch ``vcsdeploy.pyw /path/to/myapp-config.py`` to
        start ``vcsdeploy``.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        To run ``vcsdeploy`` you need:
        
          - PyQt4
        
          - mercurial installed as a Python package (i.e., you need to be able to do
            ``import mercurial`` from Python)
        
          - the `py lib`_ (``easy_install py``)
        
        .. _`py lib`: http://pylib.org/
