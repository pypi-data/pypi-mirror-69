Description: PyDitz -- a distributed issue tracker
        =====================================
        
        [![builds.sr.ht status](https://builds.sr.ht/~zondo/pyditz.svg)](https://builds.sr.ht/~zondo/pyditz?)
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This package is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the
        [Ditz](http://rubygems.org/gems/ditz) distributed issue tracker.  It
        provides a `pyditz` command-line program, which acts (mostly) the same way
        as `ditz`, and it adds several other nice things too:
        
        - Whereas `ditz`, when typed on its own, runs the `todo` command, `pyditz`
          drops you into a command shell where you can run Ditz commands and get
          completion on command names, issue names and release names according to
          context.
        
        - With PyDitz, you don't have to run it from the same directory where the
          issue database is; it will look in parent directories for it.
        
        - It keeps an intelligent cache of issues, so parsing of all the YAML files
          isn't necessary for each command.  This greatly improves speed when you
          have lots of issues.
        
        - You can extend PyDitz using plugins that you write: either simple
          standalone files (similar to the `ditz` 'hook' feature), or packages that
          use [setuptools](http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools) entrypoints.
        
        - You can use the database engine of PyDitz in Python programs to migrate
          bug databases to and from Ditz format, or create summary reports in your
          own favourite format.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        To install and run it:
        
        * [PyYAML](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML)
        * [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org)
        * [Cerberus](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cerberus)
        * [six](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six)
        
        To have nice terminal highlighting output:
        
        * [Pygments](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pygments)
        * [colorama](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama) if you're on Windows
        
        To mark up description and comment text in HTML output:
        
        * [Markups](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markups) (and the modules it needs
          to function)
        
        To run the test suite:
        
        * [PyTest](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest)
        * [Mock](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-mock)
        
        To build the documentation:
        
        * [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org)
        * The [alabaster](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/alabaster) theme
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The usual incantation will install things:
        
            pip install pyditz
        
        This will install the `ditz` module and a console command called `pyditz`
        to invoke in a similar manner to the original `ditz`.  As a convenience to
        reduce typing, a short-form version of the command is also installed: `pd`.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        The current documentation can be found online
        [here](https://pythonhosted.org/pyditz).  You can also look at an example
        of the [HTML output](https://pythonhosted.org/pyditz/_static/index.html).

        Links
        -----
        
        If you like this, here's a few more things you might want to check out:
        
        - [Pitz](https://github.com/mw44118/pitz) is another Ditz-alike issue
          tracker, also written in Python.  Its bug database is not compatible with
          Ditz, and I didn't have much luck getting it to work, but it might work
          for you.
        
        - There's another Python project of the same name called
          [akaihola-pyditz](https://github.com/akaihola/pyditz).  (I only found it
          after publishing mine, or I might have chosen another name.)  Not updated
          since 2009, but it has some ideas for logging work that might be useful.
        
        - There's also [ditz plus plus](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ditz),
          another reimplemenation written in C++, although that hasn't been
          updated since mid-2013.
        
        - If you're a fan of [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs),
          there's a [ditz-mode](https://hg.sr.ht/~zondo/ditz-mode) written for it
          that I maintain.  It works with the original Ditz, or PyDitz.
