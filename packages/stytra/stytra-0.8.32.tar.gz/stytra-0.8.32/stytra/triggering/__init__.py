class Trigger(Process):
    """ Stytra uses
    :class:`Trigger <stytra.triggering.Trigger.__init__()>` objects  to control
    the beginning of a stimulation protocol via an external event.
    In the most obvious case, the signal is sent by
    an acquisition device such as a microscope to synchronize data acquisition
    and stimulation.
    The trigger has a check_trigger function that is constantly called in a while
    loop in the run(). When :meth:`Trigger <stytra.triggering.Trigger.check_trigger(
    )>` returns True, the  start_event is
    set. The Experiment class, if it has a trigger assigned, will wait until the
    start_event to be set before starting. The control in check_trigger() is
    defined in subclasses to reflect the condition that we want to control the
    beginning of the protocol.

    **Events**

    start_event:
        event that is set when check_trigger() returns True. It
        is used by stytra to control the beginning of the protocol;

    kill_event:
        can be set to kill the Trigger process;


    **Output Queues**

    queue_trigger_params:
        can be used to send to the Experiment data about
        the triggering event or device. For example, if triggering happens from
        a microscope via a ZMQ message, setting of the microscope can be sent in
        that message to be saved together with experiment metadata.
