Description: 
        Gaussian Inflection Spline Interpolation Continuum (GISIC)
        ==========================================================
        
        GISIC is a python package for normalization of astronomical spectra.
        It is designed to accommodate spectra with heavy molecular features due to high
        elemental abundance enhancements.
        GISIC performs a gaussian smoothing of the flux array, and identifies molecular bands based on a numerical gradient. Continuum points are then interpolated with a cubic spline.
        
        
        Look how easy it is to use:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import GISIC
        
            wave, norm_flux, continuum = GISIC.normalize(wave, flux, sigma=30)
