Message Carbons
===============

Starting from poezio 0.8, poezo now supports `message carbons`_.

Message carbons are useful to duplicate chat messages between several
connected devices, so that when you switch from one to another, you
donâ€™t lose any message you sent or received.

To enable it, you only have to set the :term:`enable_carbons` option to ``true``.

.. note::

    This feature only duplicates *chat* messages (direct conversations between
    two JIDs), not groupchat messages or private conversations in groupchats.
