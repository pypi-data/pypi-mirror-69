# modes

Photonic mode solver with a nice interface and output.

* semi-vectorial and fully vectorial options,
* simple structure drawing,
* automated data saving and plotting via Matplotlib
* some limited (at this stage) data processing (finding MFD of fundamental mode), and
* easily extensible library

The documentation for this project can be found [here](http://modes.rtfd.io).

## Examples

Take a look at the jupyter notebooks

## Installation
It is recommend to install `modes` via `make install`

### Dependencies

Matplotlib can be used for plotting

* [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools),
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/),
* [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/),
* [tqdm](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tqdm), and
* [opticalmaterialspy](https://github.com/jtambasco/opticalmaterialspy).
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/),

## Acknowledgments
This finite difference mode solver is based on a modified version of [EMpy](https://github.com/lbolla/EMpy).

Thank you to [Inna Krasnokutska](https://github.com/ikrasnokutska) for testing.
