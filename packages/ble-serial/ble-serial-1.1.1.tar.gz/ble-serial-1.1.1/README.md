### BLE Serial
A tool to connect Bluetooth 4.0+ Low Energy (BLE) UART modules and normal PCs/laptops. 
It fulfills the same purpose as `rfcomm bind` for the old Bluetooth 2.0, creating a virtual serial port in `/dev/pts/x`, which makes it usable with any terminal or application.

Installation with pip: https://pypi.org/project/ble-serial/
