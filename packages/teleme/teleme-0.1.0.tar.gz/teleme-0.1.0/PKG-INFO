Description: Teleme
        ======
        Teleme(pronounced `tell-me`)  is an async, super simple Telegram Bot framework.
        
        Under Development
        -----------------
        Whilst the code has been used for years privately, since I just released the code,
        there may have been some bugs that have left undiscovered. I have decided to set
        the status of this project as Beta.
