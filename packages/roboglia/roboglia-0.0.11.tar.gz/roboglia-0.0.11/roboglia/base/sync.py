class BaseSync(BaseLoop):
    """Base processing for a sync loop.

    This class is intended to be subclassed to provide specific functionality.
    It only parses the common elements that a sync loop would need:
    the devices (provided by a group) and registers (provided by a list).
    It will check that the provided devices are on the same bus and that
    the provided registers exist in all devices.

    .. note:: Please note that this class does not actually perform any sync.
        Use the subclasses :py:class:`BaseReadSync` or
        :py:class:`BaseWriteSync` that implement read or write syncs.

    ``BaseSync`` inherits the parameters from :py:class:`BaseLoop`. In
    addition it includes the following parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    group: set
        The set with the devices used by sync; normally the robot
        constructor replaces the name of the group from YAML file with the
        actual set built earlier in the initialization.

    registers: list of str
        A list of register names (as strings) used by the sync

    auto: bool
        If the sync loop should start automatically when the robot
        starts; defaults to ``True``

    Raises
    ------
        KeyError: if mandatory parameters are not found
