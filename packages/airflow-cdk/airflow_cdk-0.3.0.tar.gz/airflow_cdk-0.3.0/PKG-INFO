Description: # airflow-cdk
        
        This project makes it simple to deploy airflow via ECS fargate using the aws cdk in Python.
        
        ## Usage
        
        `pip install airflow-cdk`
        
        ```python3
        from aws_cdk import core
        from airflow_cdk import FargateAirflow
        
        
        app = core.App()
        
        FargateAirflow(
            app,
            "airflow-cdk",
            postgres_password="replacethiswithasecretpassword")
        
        app.synth()
        ```
        
        `cdk deploy`
        
        That's it.
        
        ## Components
        
        The following aws resources will be deployed as ecs tasks within the same cluster and vpc by default:
        
        * an airflow webserver task
          * and an internet-facing application load-balancer
        * an airflow scheduler task
        * an airflow worker task
          * (note) it will auto-scale based on cpu and memory usage up to a total of 16 instances at a time by default starting from 1
        * a rabbitmq broker
        * an rds instance
        * an s3 bucket for logs
        
        ## TODOs
        
        * create a custom component to deploy airflow to an ec2 cluster as opposed to fargate
        * improve documentation
        * (possibly) subsume the [airflow stable helm chart](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/stable/airflow) as a cdk8s chart
        * (possibly) a flower service
