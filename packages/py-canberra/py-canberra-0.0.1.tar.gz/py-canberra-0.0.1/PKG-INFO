Description: py-canberra
        ===========
        
        py-canberra is a Python interface to the `libcanberra <http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/libcanberra/>`_ sound-playing library for Linux.
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        The only dependency is libcanberra, which can usually be installed from your package repository as ``libcanberra``.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            # Ubuntu
            apt install libcanberra0
        
            # RHEL / CentOS
            yum install libcanberra
        
            # Arch
            pacman -S libcanberra
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        py-canberra includes binary distributions for many platforms through `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/py-canberra/>`_
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install py-canberra
        
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Oftentimes, if libcanberra is installed, some default system sounds will be installed to ``/usr/share/sounds``, including a bell sound
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import canberra
            canberra.play(event_id='bell')
        
        This plays ``/usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/bell.oga`` on the default output device.
