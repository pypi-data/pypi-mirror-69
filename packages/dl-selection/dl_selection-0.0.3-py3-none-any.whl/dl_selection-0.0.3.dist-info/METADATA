The **dl-selection** package contains tools for performing feature 
selection with deep learning models. It supports several input layers 
for selecting features, each of which relies on a stochastic relaxation 
of the feature selection problem. See the 
[GitHub page](https://github.com/icc2115/dl-selection/) for more 
details.
