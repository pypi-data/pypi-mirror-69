        ## Publish a new version of the api on PyPi
        
        First we need to install twine and bum
        
        ```
        pip install twine bumpversion
        ```
        
        Then, we use bumpversion to increment the new version. In the example below,
        change the version to the current one. Choose from major, minor or patch version.
        
        ```
        cd ./api
        bumpversion --current-version 0.0.1 patch setup.py connected-home/__init__.py
        ```
        
        ```
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        ```
        
        
        
        ```
        python -m twine upload dist/*
        ```
