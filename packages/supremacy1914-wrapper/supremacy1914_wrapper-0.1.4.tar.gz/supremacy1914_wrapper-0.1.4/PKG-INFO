Description: # Supremacy 1914 API Wrapper
        
        This unofficial API wrapper is an implementation of the Supremacy 1914 API.
        This wrapper support API data as far as known and is intended to be easy to use.
        You'll only need to supply the server URL and the game\_id before you'll be able to get data.
        
        ## Install
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install supremacy1914-wrapper
        ```
        
        ## Demo
        
        It's advised to store the server url for the game you want to request. If you don't have the server url you can make a Supremacy instance without the url parameter, wrap it in a try except to get the server url.
        
        ```python
        from supremacy1914_wrapper import Supremacy, ServerChangeError 
        
        # Create a Supremacy instance using game id
        supremacy = Supremacy("2502620")
        
        # Send a request and except server change error
        try:
            result = supremacy.players()
        except ServerChangeError as exception:
            # update the url in the Supremacy instance
            supremacy.url = str(exception)
            result = supremacy.players()
        ```
        
        When you have to server url from the game you can pass it into the Supremacy constructor. Make sure to use a try except because the server changes over time.
        
        ```python
        from supremacy1914_wrapper import Supremacy, ServerChangeError 
        
        # Create a Supremacy instance using game id and server url
        supremacy = Supremacy("2502620", "http://xgs1.c.bytro.com")
        
        # Send a request and except server change error
        try:
            result = supremacy.players()
        except ServerChangeError as exception:
            # update the url in the Supremacy instance
            supremacy.url = str(exception)
            result = supremacy.players()
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        
        Other information about functions and exceptions can be found on the [wiki.](https://github.com/joostsijm/supremacy1914_wrapper/wiki)
        
        ## Tests
        
        Testing is done with PyTest, to run the tests use the command `pytest`. The following environment variables are required: `TEST_GAME_ID` and `TEST_GAME_URL`, save those in the `.env` file for convince
        
        ## Development
        
        I'll try to improve the wrapper as far as I need.
        If you'd like to see a new feature you can open an issue or make pull request.
