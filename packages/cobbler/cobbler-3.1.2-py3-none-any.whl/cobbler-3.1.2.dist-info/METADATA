Cobbler is a network install server. Cobbler supports PXE, virtualized installs, and reinstalling existing Linux machines. The last two modes use a helper tool, 'koan', that integrates with cobbler. There is also a web interface 'cobbler-web'. Cobbler's advanced features include importing distributions from DVDs and rsync mirrors, automatic OS installation templating, integrated yum mirroring, and built-in DHCP/DNS Management. Cobbler has a XMLRPC API for integration with other applications.
