 * send_batch.js
 *
 * Send Batch is meant to be used as an include js file. It exposes a function
 * called "send_batch", which behaves the same as "send", except that it will
 * send based on a timer, rather than immediately. This is most beneficial for
 * things that will be sending a lot of data, as it will batch them together to
 * be more efficient (calls to python are SLOW).
 *
 * Requires: dispose.js
