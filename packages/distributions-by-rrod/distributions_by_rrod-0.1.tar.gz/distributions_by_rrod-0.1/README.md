		### Gaussian Distribution
		This package contains 3 main python files. GeneralDistribution,Gaussiandistribution and BinomialDistribution
		- General Distribution:
            The Generic distribution class is for calculating and visualizing a probability distribution.
            Also there is a function called read_data_file that reads in data from a txt file. The txt file should have
            one number (float) per line. The numbers are stored in the data attribute. Currently using numbers.txt as an example
        - Gaussian Distribution:
            The Gaussian distribution class for calculating and visualizing a Gaussian distribution.
		- Binomial Distribution:
		    The Binomial distribution class for calculating and visualizing a Binomial distribution.
