        > Write articles for your static gen blog in Notion.
        
        
        
        ## Work on progress! 
        
        This is a super early version of Notoma — and this document is half true and half fiction.
        
        
        ## Install
        
        Notoma is available via Pip and Homebrew: 
        
        ```bash
        # Installing with pip, use this if you plan using Notoma as a python library.
        pip install notoma
        ```
        
        ```bash
        # Installing with brew
        # Use this if you just want the CLI tool
        brew install cask/xnutsive/notoma
        ```
        
        ## Basic Usage
        
        Notoma provides commands to: 
        - Convert contents of your Notion Blog database to a bunch of Markdown files.
        - Watch Notion Blog database for updates and regenerate Markdown files on any updates.
        - Create a new Notion database for your Blog with all required fields.
        
        Here's the basic usage example: 
        
        ```bash
        notoma convert --dest ./posts/
        ```
        
        This example assumes that you have a `.env` config file with authentication and blog url parameters in it, this guide covers those later.
        
        #### Authenticating in Notion
        
        Since Notion doesn't yet (May 2020) have a public API, Notoma requires your Notion cookie auth token that you can get from your browser.
        
        You can provide `token_v2` option to every command line call, or store it in your environment, or `.env` file.
        
        #### Converting your Notion articles
