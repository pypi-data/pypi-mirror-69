Description: A tool to visualize and play with CMB maps. ``psplay`` is a ``jupyter`` extension to allowinteractive visualization of CMB maps through `Leaflet <leafletjs.com>`_ library. ``psplay`` alsoprovides a set of tools based on `pspy <https://github.com/simonsobs/pspy>`_ to compute and to showCMB power spectra.All the specific javascript library developed for ``psplay`` is done by `Sigurd Naess <https://github.com/amaurea>`_.The build process and javascript architecture is highly inspired by`ipyleaflet <https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet>`_ project... image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/psplay.svg?style=flat   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psplay/.. image:: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/jupyter-leaflet-car   :target: https://www.npmjs.com/package/jupyter-leaflet-car.. image:: https://travis-ci.com/xgarrido/psplay.svg?branch=master   :target: https://travis-ci.com/xgarrido/psplayExamples--------* `From simulated CAR map to psplay <https://github.com/xgarrido/psplay/blob/master/examples/car_simulation_to_analysis.ipynb>`_* `From HEALPIX map file to psplay <https://github.com/xgarrido/psplay/blob/master/examples/healpix_simulation_to_analysis.ipynb>`_Installation------------To install, you will need to have or to install ``numpy``. Then, run.. code:: shell   $ pip install psplay [--user]``psplay`` runs within a Jupyter notebook and we recommend to use JupyterLab to fully enjoy ``psplay``To enable the extension within Jupyter, you will need to install several JupyterLab extensionsespecially the Python ``plotly`` `library <https://plotly.com/python>`_ and the Jupyter `widgets <https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets>`_.For JupyterLab > 2.0.0, you can do.. code:: shell   $ jupyter labextension install plotlywidget jupyterlab-plotly   $ jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-sidecarFinally, you need to install the `jupyter-leaflet-car <https://www.npmjs.com/package/jupyter-leaflet-car>`_ extension.. code:: shell   $ jupyter labextension install jupyter-leaflet jupyter-leaflet-carInstallation from sources-------------------------For a development installation (requires `npm <https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm>`_).. code:: shell   $ git clone https://github.com/xgarrido/psplay.git   $ cd psplay   $ pip install -e .If you are using the classic Jupyter Notebook you need to install the nbextension:.. code:: shell   $ jupyter nbextension install --py --symlink --sys-prefix psplay   $ jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix psplayIf you are using JupyterLab, you need to install the labextension:.. code:: shell   $ jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager jsNote for developers:- the ``-e`` pip option allows one to modify the Python code in-place. Restart the kernel in order  to see the changes.- the ``--symlink`` argument on Linux or OS X allows one to modify the JavaScript code  in-place. This feature is not available with Windows.For automatically building the JavaScript code every time there is a change, run the followingcommand from the ``psplay/js/`` directory:.. code:: shell   $ npm run watchIf you are on JupyterLab you also need to run the following in a separate terminal:.. code:: shell   $ jupyter lab --watchEvery time a JavaScript build has terminated you need to refresh the Notebook page in order to loadthe JavaScript code again.
