# A Python library for solving textbook control problems

The tbcontrol package collects functions useful to solve the kinds of problems encountered in undergraduate process control textbooks. It is the distributable part of a larger project to develop Jupyter notebooks for dynamics and control.

The [repository](https://github.com/alchemyst/Dynamics-and-Control) collects notebooks for the subjects CPN321 (Process Dynamics), and CPB421 (Process Control) at the Chemical Engineering department of the University of Pretoria.

You can experiment with the notebooks without installing anything using this link: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/alchemyst/Dynamics-and-Control)

The links below will allow you to view the notebooks using the notebook viewer. You can also click on the "Launch Binder" badge above to launch a notebook server which will allow you to run all the code online.

We use Travis CI to check every update made to the repository. Note that we only test on the version of Python specified in `environment.yml`.
