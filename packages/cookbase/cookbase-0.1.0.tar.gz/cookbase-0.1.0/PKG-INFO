Description: # Cookbase
        A platform to validate, store and manage cooking recipes based on the JSON Cookbase Format.
        
        Cookbase proposes and implements a data model striving for an *as-complete-as-possible* data structure applied to cooking data. A new suite of data formats (the [**Cookbase Recipe Standard Format**]) and a consistent data model structure with its database architecture and recipe data analysis tools are included in the Cookbase project.
