# python_SMCRateware
Python project for [SMC3 Rateware](https://www.smc3.com/rateware.htm) SOAP API integrations.

# Package Development

## Examples:

### Sample CsvDataFrame Integration

#### tests/shipments.csv

    ```csv
    ship_id,ship_date,origin_zip,origin_country,dest_zip,dest_country,freight_class,weight
    0,1/01/19,19106,USA,07981,USA,125,456.2
    0,1/01/19,19106,USA,07981,USA,125,500.41
    1,1/01/19,07981,USA,07981,USA,200,201.0
    2,1/01/19,07981,USA,07981,USA,200,502.1
    ```

#### .env

    ```dotenv
    API_LICENSE_KEY=
    API_USERNAME=
    API_PASSWORD=
    ```

#### [install](https://pypi.org/project/smcrateware/)

```pip install smc3rateware```

#### .py

    ```python
    import smcrateware as smc
    import pandas as pd

    df = smc.rate_usingLTLRateShipmentMultipleRequest_fromdf('shipments.csv')
    ```

# Under Development Usage
Prior to packaging this python up for python-smcrateware the code will be finalized for a specific scope.
From there contributions will be allowed on a feature improvement/addition/deletion basis. Until then
this project is to be used with the following steps:

Setup .env

    ```dotenv
    API_LICENSE_KEY=
    API_USERNAME=
    API_PASSWORD=
    ```

For windows CMD (need bash configured):

1. ```git clone https://github.com/NFI-Industries/python_SMCRateware.git```
2. ```cd python_SMCRateware```
3. ```start .```
4. drop .env in python_SMCRateware
5. ```bash```
6. ```/run.sh```

else:

1. ```git clone https://github.com/NFI-Industries/python_SMCRateware.git```
2. ```cd python_SMCRateware```
3. ```start .```
4. drop .env in python_SMCRateware
5. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
6. ```python main.py -T='TariffNAme' -F='Full/Filepath.csv```

or use the *./run.sh* method if you'd like.

**NOTE:** you may need to restart & re-run the notebook after the initial run if you're trying to use *examples/notebooks/example_csv_to_pddataframe.ipynb*.
The kernel needs to know the package exists.

**TODO:** 

- design (rate_usingLTLRateShipmentMultipleRequest_fromdf is too explicit)
- non-LTLRateShipmentMultiple usage
