<p> This application is written in Python,
    with the help of the <a href="https://www.reportlab.com">ReportLab</a> library
    (the web part is powered by the <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com">flask</a> framework).
    The code is open-source
    and is available here: <a href="https://framagit.org/marbaix/ember-factory">framagit.org</a>.
    The ability of this application to reproduce several figures (independently) published by the IPCC was
    carefully tested. However, this is not a product of the IPCC (which is
    not responsible for projects or researches).
<p>
<h2>Versions</h2>
<p>
    Although the web application and layout details were improved over time, there is no change affecting the translation
    of the risk levels provided as input to colours in the burning embers. The changes are recorded on
    <a href="https://framagit.org/marbaix/ember-factory">framagit.org</a>.
</p>
<h2>Development history</h2>
</p>
    This software was created by philippe.marbaix -at- uclouvain.be at the end of 2019.
    The first objective was to produce a figure for a paper that is now under review (05/2020).
    The work for this project was done outside of my duties at UCLouvain, which are related to the
    <a href="https://plateforme-wallonne-giec.be">Plateforme wallonne pour le GIEC</a>,
    and represent 80% of my work time.
    Help is welcome to further improve the application. All contributions will be recognised :-).
