This is a Python implementation of `Chris Bail's textnets package for R`_.  It

The underlying idea behind textnets is presented in this paper:

  Christopher A. Bail, "`Combining natural language processing and network
  analysis to examine how advocacy organizations stimulate conversation on social
  media`__," *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States
  of America* 113, no. 42 (2016), 11823â€“11828, doi:10.1073/pnas.1607151113.

Features
--------

The library builds on the state-of-the-art library `spacy`_ for
natural-language processing and `igraph`_ for network analysis. It uses the
`Leiden algorithm`_ for community detection, which is able to perform community
detection on the bipartite (word--group) network.

.. _`Leiden algorithm`: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08473
.. _`igraph`: http://igraph.org/python/
.. _`spacy`: http://spacy.io/

.. code:: python

    from textnets import Corpus, Textnet


    c = Corpus.from_files('~/nltk_data/corpora/state_union/*.txt')
    tn = Textnet(c.noun_phrases())
    g_bipartite = tn.graph
    g_bipartite.vs['cluster'] = tn.clusters.membership
    g_groups = tn.project(node_type='doc')
    g_words = tn.project(node_type='term')

In addition to providing a Python library, textnets can also be used as a
command-line tool to generate network graphs from text corpora.

.. code:: bash

    $ textnets --lex noun_phrases --node-type groups ~/nltk_data/corpora/state_union | gzip > sotu_groups.graphmlz

Run ``textnets --help`` for usage instructions.

Installing
----------

In a `virtual environment`_, run ``python setup.py install`` followed by ``python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm``.
