        ## How are they sent?
        
        - Windows
          - Notifications are natively sent with ``windows.ui.notifications`` through Powershell.
        - macOS
          - Notifications are sent with a bundled .app. 
            - Please read below on setting application icons.
        - Linux
          - Notifications are sent with notify-send.
        
        
        
        No dependencies are required other than loguru.

        ## Usage
        
        
        
        ```python
        # Send a simple text notification.
        
        import notifypy
        
        notification = notifypy.Notify()
        notification.send()
        
        # This sends a notification with the default values.
        
        
        # Updating the values
        
        notification.title = "Really Cool Title"
        notification.message = "Even cooler message."
        notification.icon = "path/to/icon.png"
        notification.application_name = "SuperCoolApp"
        
        notification.send()
        
        
        ```
        
        ```python
        import notifypy
        
        # You can quickly initalize with a 'default' message.
        
        notifification = notifypy.Notify(
        	default_notification_title="Function completed",
            defualt_application_name="SuperLongFunction"
        )
        
        def super_long_function():
            # super long stuff here
            result = result_of_long_function
            
           	notification.message = str(result_of_long_function)
            notification.send()
            
        ```
        
        ```python
        
        import notifypy
        
        notification = notify.Notify()
        # Send the notification without blocking.
        
        notification.send(block=False)
        ```

        ## Important Caveats 
        
        - As it stands (May 18, 2020), this is simply a notification service. There is *no* support for embedding custom actions (buttons, dialogs) regardless of platform. Other then telling you if the shell command was sent, there is also no confirmation on user action on the notification. 
        
        ~~- This is **blocking**. This will block most programs when *sending* the notification. This will be changed in the future. This *may* cause GUI applications to freeze. Do your own testing.~~ v0.0.8.
        
        - There is no support for sending custom sounds, and is silent for most platforms. (notable exclusion is windows.). This will be changed in the future.
        - macOS does **not** support custom icons OTF. You will need to bundle a customized version of the notifier embedded with your custom icon. 
        
        
        
        ### Windows Specific.
        
        - No support for balloon tips (pre Win10).. This will be changed in the future.
