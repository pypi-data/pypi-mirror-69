~~~~~~~

-   Attempting to load any type of ROI which is fully offscreen to the top or left of the image now produces an error.
    (`#140 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/140>`__)

    (`#135 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/135>`__)


Version `0.7.0 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/tree/0.7.0>`__
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Release date: 2020-05-04.
`Full commit changelog <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/compare/0.6.4...0.7.0>`__.

.. _v0.7.0 Security:

Security
~~~~~~~~

-   **Caution:** This release knowingly exposes a new security vulnerability.
    In numpy 1.16, the default behaviour of
    `numpy.load <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.load.html>`__
    changed to stop loading files saved with pickle compression by default,
    due to potential security problems. However, the default behaviour of
    `numpy.save <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.save.html>`__
    is still to save with pickling enabled. In order to preserve our
    user-experience and backward compatibility with existing fissa cache files,
    we have changed our behaviour to allow numpy to load from pickled files.
    (`#111 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/111>`__)

.. _v0.7.0 Changed:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-   Officially drop support for Python 3.3 and 3.4.
    Add `python_requires` to package metadata, specifying Python 2.7 or >=3.5 is required.
    (`#114 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/114>`__)
-   Allow tuples and other sequences to be image and roi inputs to FISSA, not just lists.
    (`#73 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/73>`__)
-   Multiprocessing is no longer used when the number of cores is specified as 1.
    (`#74 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/74>`__)
-   Changed default ``axis`` argument to internal function ``fissa.roitools.shift_2d_array`` from ``None`` to ``0``.
    (`#54 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/54>`__)
-   Documentation updates.
    (`#112 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/112>`__,
    `#115 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/115>`__,
    `#119 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/119>`__,
    `#120 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/120>`__,

    (`#111 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/111>`__)
-   Problems reading ints correctly from ImageJ rois on Windows; fixed for Python 3 but not Python 2.
    This problem does not affect Unix, which was already working correctly on both Python 2 and 3.
    (`#90 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/90>`__)
-   Reject unsupported ``axis`` argument to internal function ``fissa.roitools.shift_2d_array``.
    (`#54 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/54>`__)
-   Don't round number of npil segments down to 0 in ``fissa.roitools.split_npil`` when using ``adaptive_num=True``.
    (`#54 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/54>`__)
-   Handling float ``num_slices`` in ``fissa.roitools.split_npil``, for when ``adaptive_num=True``, which was causing problems on Python 3.
    (`#54 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/54>`__)

.. _v0.7.0 Added:

Added
~~~~~

-   Test suite additions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Release date: 2020-04-07.
`Full commit changelog <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/compare/0.6.3...0.6.4>`__.

.. _v0.6.3 Fixed:

Fixed
~~~~~

-   Specify a maximum version for the panel dependency of holoviews on
    Python <3.6, which allows us to continue supporting Python 3.5, otherwise
    dependencies fail to install.
    (`#101 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/101>`__)
-   Save deltaf to MATLAB compatible output.
    (`#70 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/70>`__)
-   Wipe downstream data stored in the experiment object if upstream data
    changes, so data that is present is always consistent with each other.
    (`#93 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/93>`__)
-   Prevent slashes in paths from doubling up if the input path has a trailing
    slash.
    (`#71 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/71>`__)
-   Documentation updates.
    (`#91 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/91>`__,

    (`#62 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/62>`__)
-   Basic usage notebook wasn't supplying the correct ``datahandler_custom`` argument for the custom datahandler (it was using ``datahandler`` instead, which is incorrect; this was silently ignored previously but will now trigger an error).
    (`#62 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/62>`__)
-   Use ``ncores_preparation`` for perparation step, not ``ncores_separation``.

    (`#59 <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/pull/59>`__)
-   Allow both byte strings and unicode strings to be arguments of functions which require strings.
