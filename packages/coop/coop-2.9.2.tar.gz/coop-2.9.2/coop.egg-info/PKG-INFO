Description: Coop - base for all (most) Neon Jungle sites
        ============================================
        
        This is a base to build all Neon Jungle sites off.
        This package contains all the common code shared
        between sites, with the ideal Neon Jungle site containing only
        model definitions, templates, and front end assets.
        
        Making a release
        ----------------
        
        Upgrade the version in ``coop/_version.py``.
        Coops version stays in step with Wagtail. i.e. Coop 2.4.x uses Wagtail 2.4.x.
        Point releases are used to add features during a Wagtail version lifespan.
        
        Update the CHANGELOG. Please.
        
        Tag your release:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ git tag "x.y.z"
            $ git push --tags
        
        Make a virtual environment and activate it. You may already have one from last
        time:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ python3 -m venv venv
            $ source venv/bin/activate
            $ pip install wheel twine # Only required once per venv
        
        Then, package up and publish the package:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ rm -rf dist/ # delete any previous dists
            $ ./setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
            $ twine upload dist/*
        
        And you are done!
