""" Custom template system for osxphotos (implemented in PhotoInfo.render_template) """

# Rolled my own template system because:
# 1. Needed to handle multiple values (e.g. album, keyword)
# 2. Needed to handle default values if template not found
# 3. Didn't want user to need to know python (e.g. by using Mako which is
#    already used elsewhere in this project)
# 4. Couldn't figure out how to do #1 and #2 with str.format()
#
# This code isn't elegant but it seems to work well.  PRs gladly accepted.
