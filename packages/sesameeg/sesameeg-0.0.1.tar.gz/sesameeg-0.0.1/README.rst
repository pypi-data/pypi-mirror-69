SESAMEEG: SEquential Semi-Analytic Montecarlo Estimation for MEEG
=================================================================

This is a Python3 implementation of the Bayesian multi-dipole modeling method and Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm
SESAME described in [1]_.
The algorithm takes in input a forward solution and a MEEG evoked data time series, and outputs a posterior
probability map for brain activity, as well as estimates of the  number of sources, their locations and their
amplitudes.

Installation
============

To install this package, the easiest way is using ``pip``. It will install this
package and its dependencies. The ``setup.py`` depends on ``numpy``, ``scipy``  and ``mne``
for the installation so it is advised to install them beforehand. To
install this package, please run the following commands:

(Latest stable version)

.. code::

    pip install numpy scipy mne
    pip install sesameeg

If you do not have admin privileges on the computer, use the ``--user`` flag
with ``pip``. To upgrade, use the ``--upgrade`` flag provided by ``pip``.

To check if everything worked fine, you can run:

.. code::

	python -c 'import sesameeg'

and it should not give any error messages.
