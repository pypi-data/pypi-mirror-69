Description: This is the ailearn AI algorithm package. It includes three modules: Swarm, RL and utils.
        In swarm module, particle swarm algorithm, artificial fish swarm algorithm and firefly algorithm are implemented.
        The evolution strategy and the commonly used function to be optimized to evaluate the intelligent algorithm are also implemented in this module.
        The RL module consists of two parts, the TabularRL part and the environment part.
        The TabularRL part integrates some classical reinforcement learning algorithms, including Q-learning, Q(lambda), Sarsa, Sarsa(lambda), Dyna-Q, etc.
        The environment part integrates some classic test environments of reinforcement learning, such as the frozen lake problem, cliffwalking problem, gridworld problem, etc.
