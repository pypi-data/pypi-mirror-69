Description: # deploymentutils
        
        This repo contains a small python package to facilitate deployment of some personal projects.
        
        
        ## Overview
        
        This package provides a thin layer on top of [fabric](https://www.fabfile.org/) to execute commands with a state like
        - current working directory
        - activated virtual environment (not yet implemented)
        
        It also tries to simplify to deploy/maintain multiple instances of the same software but with varying fixtures, including a local instances for testing.
        
        ## Motivation
        
        The package is mainly intended to facilitate deployment tasks (eg. for django apps) by running a simple python script.
        Compared to configuration management tools like *Ansible* this approach is far less powerful and scalable.
        However, it might be easier to understand for developers and thus lowering the hurdle to deploy applications by them selves.
        
        
        ## Status
        
        Still under development and poorly tested.
