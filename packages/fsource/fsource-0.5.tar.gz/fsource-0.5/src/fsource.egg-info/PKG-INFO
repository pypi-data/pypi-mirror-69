Description: fsource - Fortran static analysis tool
        ======================================

        fsource is a collection of tools allowing you to parse Fortran 77 through
        Fortran 2008 programs.  It is written in pure Python and has no external
        dependencies.
        
        You install fsource via pip:
        
            $ pip install fsource
        
        or simply download the [source], since there are no external dependencies
        (note that you should use `bin/fsource` instead of `fsource` in this case).
        
        fsource currently features a [command line interface]:
        
         - a [parser], which takes a Fortran file and outputs an abstract syntax tree
           (for the definitions) allowing you to extract modules, subprograms, derived
           types, parameters, etc.:
        
               $ fsource parse FILE.f90
        
         - a [wrapper], which builds on the Fortran parser to extract module variables,
           types and subroutines which can be interfaced with C and generates header
           files for them:
        
               $ fsource wrap FILE.f90
        
         - a [line splicer] and a [lexer], low-level tools which split a Fortran file
           into a set of logical lines and tokens, respectively.  This allows you to
           set up your parsing infrastructure on top of fsource:
        
               $ fsource splice FILE.f90
               $ fsource lex FILE.f90
