        "The Regressive Imagery Dictionary (RID) is a coding scheme for text analysis
        that is designed to measure 'primordial' and conceptual content. Primordial
        thought is the kind of free-form, associative thinking involved in fantasy
        and dreams. Like Freud's id, I guess. Conceptual (or secondary) thought is
        logical, reality-based and focused on problem solving."
