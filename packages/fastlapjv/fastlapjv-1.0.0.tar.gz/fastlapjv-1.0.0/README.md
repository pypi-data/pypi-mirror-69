Linear Assignment Problem solver using kNN-based Jonker-Volgenant algorithm
==================================================================

Codes for kNN-based Jonker-Volgenant algorithm described in our paper ["OoDAnalyzer: Interactive Analysis of
Out-of-Distribution Samples"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8994105) (TVCG 2020).

Installing
----------
```
pip3 install fastlapjv
```
Tested on Windows, and Linux.

Usage Example
-----
Run this example to compare our method and the eaxct JV algorithm. Runing this example requires the installation of [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and [lapjv](https://github.com/src-d/lapjv).
```
python test/test.py
```
