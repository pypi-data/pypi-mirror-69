rotating-free-proxies
============================
Avoid being banned by webpages when you crawl them. This is an extension to the amazing scrapy-rotating-proxies_ library. The main target of this library is to get proxies dynamically when the spider is running. This library automatically fetches freely available lists of proxies from free-proxy-list.net_.

    DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
        'rotating_free_proxies.middlewares.RotatingProxyMiddleware': 610,
