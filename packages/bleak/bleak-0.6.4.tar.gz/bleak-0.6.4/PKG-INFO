        Bleak is an acronym for Bluetooth Low Energy platform Agnostic Klient.
        
        * Free software: MIT license
        * Documentation: https://bleak.readthedocs.io.
        
        Bleak is a GATT client software, capable of connecting to BLE devices
        acting as GATT servers. It is designed to provide a asynchronous,
        cross-platform Python API to connect and communicate with e.g. sensors.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install bleak
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Supports Windows 10, version 16299 (Fall Creators Update) or greater
        * Supports Linux distributions with BlueZ >= 5.43
        * OS X/macOS support via Core Bluetooth API, from at least OS X version 10.11
        
        Bleak supports reading, writing and getting notifications from
        GATT servers, as well as a function for discovering BLE devices.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To discover Bluetooth devices that can be connected to:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import asyncio
            from bleak import discover
        
            async def run():
                devices = await discover()
                for d in devices:
                    print(d)
        
            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
            loop.run_until_complete(run())
        
        
        Connect to a Bluetooth device and read its model number:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import asyncio
            from bleak import BleakClient
        
            address = "24:71:89:cc:09:05"
            MODEL_NBR_UUID = "00002a24-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb"
        
            async def run(address, loop):
                async with BleakClient(address, loop=loop) as client:
                    model_number = await client.read_gatt_char(MODEL_NBR_UUID)
                    print("Model Number: {0}".format("".join(map(chr, model_number))))
        
            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
            loop.run_until_complete(run(address, loop))
