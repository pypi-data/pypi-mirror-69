Welcome! This is the third and hopefully final reboot that I do on my cryptopals project.

When this project is complete, it will be a python package that provides you access to some of the building blocks of cryptology. It will also be a Flask app that will use the package to (hopefully) teach you something about how the building blocks work and how they fit together.

Stay tuned!
