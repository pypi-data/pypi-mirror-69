Description: # FinNews
        
        This is a package to help me with a personal project dealing with sentiment analysis and headline classification. The package has a lot of influence from the [newscatcher package](https://github.com/kotartemiy/newscatcher). While that package is great for getting general news, I need more financial related news that I wasn't getting.
        
        This package is meant to get news from various RSS sources. Current RSS sources:
        - CNBC
        ```python
        fn.CNBC(topics=['finance', 'earnings'], save_feeds=True)
        ```
        - Seeking Alpha
        ```python
        # SeekingAlpha has support for RSS feeds by ticker, tickers can be passed as a topic and are denoted by $XXX
        fn.SeekingAlpha(topics=['financial', '$AAPL'], save_feeds=True)
        ```
        
        You can install using pip by downloading directly from Pypi:
        ```
        $ pip install FinNews
        ```
        or from this repo:
        ```
        $ pip install git+https://github.com/scaratozzolo/FinNews
        ```
        
        Example usage:
        ```python
        import FinNews as fn
        
        cnbc_feed = fn.CNBC(topics=['finance', 'earnings', 'business'])
        print(cnbc_feed.get_news())
        print(cnbc_feed.possible_topics())
        ```
        
        Todo:
        - [x] CNBC
        - [x] Seeking Alpha
        - [ ] investing.com
        - [ ] WSJ
