        umqtt.simple2
        =============
        
        umqtt.simple2_ is a MQTT client for MicroPython. (Note that it uses some
        MicroPython shortcuts and doesn't work with CPython).
        
        Support MQTT Version 3.1.1 only.
        
        It certainly works with micropython ports: esp8266 and esp32. It should also
        work with other ports, but the library was not tested under other ports.
        
        MQTT client with more features
        ------------------------------
        
        There's a separate umqtt.robust2_  module which builds
        on umqtt.simple2_ adds the ability to reconnect.
        It is able to send unsent messages itself. And many more...
        
        Differences between umqtt.simple and umqtt.simple2
        --------------------------------------------------
        * When sending messages from QoS=1, there is no problem with "suspending"
          the script while waiting for confirmation of message receipt by the server.
        * When subscribing to a channel, there is no problem with "suspending"
          the script while waiting for confirmation of the subscription by the server.
        * Information about receiving or failing to receive a message from QoS=1 or subscription
          can only be received by registering a callback using the :python:`set_callback_status()` method.
        * Currently, the module informs about errors in more detailed way. See the umqtt/errno.py file.
        * The application should also not hang up when using :python:`check_msg()`
        * The code compiled for MPY files, is about 30% larger than the original one.
          So this library has gained more functionality (maybe reliability),
          but this was done at the expense of the amount of code.
        
        How and where to install this code?
        -----------------------------------
        You can install using the upip:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import upip
            upip.install("micropython-umqtt.simple2")
        
        or
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            micropython -m upip install -p modules micropython-umqtt.simple2
        
        
        You can also clone this repository, and install it manually:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            git clone https://github.com/fizista/micropython-umqtt.simple2.git
        
        Manual installation gives you more possibilities:
        
        * You can compile this library into MPY files using the :bash:`compile.sh` script.
        * You can remove comments from the code with the command: :bash:`python setup.py minify`
        * You can of course copy the code as it is, if you don't mind.
        
        **Please note that the PyPi repositories contain optimized code (no comments).**
        
        Design requirements
        -------------------
        
        * Memory efficiency.
        * Avoid infamous design anti-patterns like "callback hell".
        * Support for both publishing and subscription via a single client
          object (another alternative would be to have separate client classes
          for publishing and subscription).
        
        API design
        ----------
        
        Based on the requirements above, there are following API traits:
        
        * All data related to MQTT messages is encoded as bytes. This includes
          both message content AND topic names (even though MQTT spec states
          that topic name is UTF-8 encoded). The reason for this is simple:
          what is received over network socket is binary data (bytes) and
          it would require extra step to convert that to a string, spending
          memory on that. Note that this applies only to topic names (because
          they can be both sent and received). Other parameters specified by
          MQTT as UTF-8 encoded (e.g. ClientID) are accepted as strings.
        * Subscribed messages are delivered via a callback. This is to avoid
          using a queue for subscribed messages, as otherwise they may be
          received at any time (including when client expects other type
          of server response, so there're 2 choices: either deliver them
          immediately via a callback or queue up until an "expected" response
          arrives). Note that lack of need for a queue is delusive: the
          runtime call stack forms an implicit queue in this case. And unlike
          explicit queue, it's much harder to control. This design was chosen
          because in a common case of processing subscribed messages it's
          the most efficient. However, if in subscription callback, new
          messages of QoS>0 are published, this may lead to deep, or
          infinite recursion (the latter means an application will terminate
          with :python:`RuntimeException`).
        
        API reference
        -------------
        
        Taking into account API traits described above, umqtt pretty closely
        follows MQTT control operations, and maps them to class methods:
        
        * ``connect(...)`` - Connect to a server. Returns True if this connection
          uses persisten session stored on a server (this will be always False if
          clean_session=True argument is used (default)).
        * ``disconnect()`` - Disconnect from a server, release resources.
        * ``ping()`` - Ping server (response is processed automatically by wait_msg()).
        * ``publish()`` - Publish a message.
        * ``subscribe()`` - Subscribe to a topic.
        * ``set_callback()`` - Set callback for received subscription messages. call(topic, msg, retained)
        * ``set_callback_status()`` - Set callback for received subscription messages. call(pid, status)
        * ``set_last_will()`` - Set MQTT "last will" message. Should be called
          *before* connect().
        * ``wait_msg()`` - Wait for a server message. A subscription message will be
          delivered to a callback set with set_callback(), any other messages
          will be processed internally.
        * ``check_msg()`` - Check if there's pending message from server. If yes,
          process the same way as wait_msg(), if not, return immediately.
        
        ``wait_msg()`` and ``check_msg()`` are "main loop iteration" methods, blocking
        and non-blocking version. They should be called periodically in a loop,
        ``wait_msg()`` if you don't have any other foreground tasks to perform
        (i.e. your app just reacts to subscribed MQTT messages), ``check_msg()``
        if you process other foreground tasks too.
        
        Note that you don't need to call ``wait_msg()``/``check_msg()`` if you only
        publish messages with QoS==0, never subscribe to them.
        
        If you are using a subscription and/or sending QoS>0 messages, you must run one of these
        commands ( ``wait_msg()`` or ``check_msg()`` ).
        
        **For more detailed information about API please see the source code
        (which is quite short and easy to review) and provided examples.**
        
        
        Supported MQTT features
        -----------------------
        
        QoS 0 and 1 are supported for both publish and subscribe. QoS2 isn't
        supported to keep code size small. Besides ClientID, only "clean
        session" parameter is supported for connect as of now.
        
        Simple library testing
        ----------------------
        The current tests are not only to test the code, but also to check it in a real environment. Therefore, a good idea,
        before we use this library in our own project, is to test its operation with the MQTT broker.
        
        To test if the library works well with your device and MQTT broker,
        use the TestMQTT class from the `tests.py` module.
        
        If you don't have your own MQTT broker yet, you can use the free MQTT test broker (test.mosquitto.org).
        
        There is also a sample file `main.py`(`example_test_main.py`),
        In this file we add only network configuration. Upload this file to your device with umqtt.simple2_
        library and `tests.py` module. Then reset the device and watch the results in the console.
        
        Different problems
        ------------------
        * Wrong topic format during subscription - you'll get `OSError: [Errno 104] ECONNRESET` in subscribe()
          or `MQTTException: 1` in the `wait_msg()/check_msg()`
