Description: # Unimon Control 🎛
        
        Unimon Control is port of [ClickOS Control](https://github.com/sysml/clickos-ctl) into Python. This hopes to make life easier for future edits given the amou t of string handling required from this program...
        
        This currently supports all the same features as the original ClickOS Control so can be used as a stand in replacement. This program does **not** depend on `libxenstore`, but does depend on `pyxs`.
        
        See the README for ClickOS Control [here](https://github.com/sysml/clickos-ctl/blob/master/README.md).
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install using pip (for python 3):
        ```bash
        pip install --user unimon-ctl
        sudo unimon-ctl -h
        ```
        (script should be added to `~/.local/bin` by default)
        
        Or use with Docker:
        
        ```bash
        docker run --rm -it -v /var/run/xenstored/socket:/var/run/xenstored/socket willfantom/unimon-ctl -h
        ```
        
        ## Re-Implemented ClickOS-Ctl Features
        
        - Use xenstore to communicate with clickos instance ✅
        - Install/Remove click configs to clickos domains ✅
          - via `install`/`remove` sub commands
        - Start/Stop clickos routers ✅
          - via `start`/`stop` sub commands
        
        ## Added Features
        
        - Get list of clickos domain's routers and states ✅
          - via `list` sub command
        - Check state of specific router ✅
          - via `state` sub command
        - Prints some emoji ✅
        - Pythony (can be installed via `pip`) 🐍
        - Dockery (can be ran using Docker) 🐳
        
        ## Notice
        
        This has been made as part of my PhD work, so will not be maintained beyond the feature set I require.
