# Miprem

_A **m**er**i**t **p**rofile **re**nderer for **m**ajority judgment._

This project aims to generate vector and bitmap images representing the merit profile of a
[majority judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_judgment) election, based on the merit profile raw data.
Miprem does not process poll results, it just render as pretty as possible.

*This project is under active development - installation and usage will rapidly evolve.*
