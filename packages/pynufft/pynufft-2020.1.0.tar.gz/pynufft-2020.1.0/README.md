# PyNUFFT: Python non-uniform fast Fourier transform

A minimal "getting start" tutorial is available at http://jyhmiinlin.github.io/pynufft/ .
 
### Summary

PyNUFFT is for fun and it attempts to implement the min-max NUFFT of Fessler and Sutton, with the following features:

- Based on Python numerical libraries, such as Numpy, Scipy (matplotlib for displaying examples).
- Multi-dimensional NUFFT.
- Support of PyCUDA and PyOpenCL. 
- LGPLv3
