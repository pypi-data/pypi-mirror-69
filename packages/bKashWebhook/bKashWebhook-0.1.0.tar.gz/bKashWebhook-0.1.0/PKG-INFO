        ## Quickstart
        ### Installation
        Install from pypi: 
        ```shell script
        pip install bKashWebhook
        ```
        
        ## Security
        bKashWebhook package does not provide any kind of security. But payload content security handle by **bKash** <br/>
        N.B. You need to secure your API endpoint yourself. 
        ## Example 
        ```python
        import json
        from bkash_webhook import BkashWebhookListener
        bkash = BkashWebhookListener(json.loads("bKash Webhook Payload"))
        res = bkash.bkash_response_process()
        print(res)
        # You will get bKash Payload if everything is okay. 
        ```

        ## Trade off
        - Currently, Coverage result is 98%. Two test cases don't cover and those test cases are not possible to cover.
        These test cases do not impact to core response. So don't worry. ValidationError Exception would manage that type error.
