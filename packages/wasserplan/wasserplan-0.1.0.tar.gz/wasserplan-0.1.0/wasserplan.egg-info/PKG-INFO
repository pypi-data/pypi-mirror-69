Description: # Wasserplan
        `wasserplan` is a library for computing 1-Wasserstein distances between [GerryChain](https://github.com/mggg/gerrychain) partitions.
        
        # Dependencies
        `wasserplan` depends on GerryChain and [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/). We recommend installing these dependencies with Anaconda (see the [official GerryChain installation instructions](https://github.com/mggg/gerrychain#installation)).
        
        ## Using
        We principally use this library to compute pairwise transport distances which we (approximately) project into 2D Euclidean space. A simple demonstration of this use case using Virginia congressional districts is available as a notebook (open in Colab).
        
        ## Performance
        By default, `wasserplan` uses the open-source, lightweight [ECOS solver](https://github.com/embotech/ecos), which is included with CVXPY. However, this solver may exhibit performance issues for large graphs (thousands of nodes). Performance can be improved by using a commercial solver such as [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/).
