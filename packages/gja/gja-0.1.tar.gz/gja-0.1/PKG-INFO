Description: # gauss-jordan-assistant
        
        Enabling live demonstration of the Gauss-Jordan algorithm in a terminal/console.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        - Python 3.8+
        - Rich (https://pypi.org/project/rich/)
        
        To work properly on Windows (which is what I use), you need the following:
        
        - Windows Terminal (https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal)
        
        ## Description
        
        The idea of this project is to enable live demonstration of using the Gauss-Jordan algorithm to solve systems of linear equations, using a simple console. This project is developed on Windows but should work using other operating systems.
        
        Commands will include:
            - Defining the size of a matrix; number of rows limited to 9.
            - Entering its row
            - Using elementary row operations to transform the matrix
            - Optionnally, save the entire process using LaTeX syntax.
        
        
        English and French are supported.
