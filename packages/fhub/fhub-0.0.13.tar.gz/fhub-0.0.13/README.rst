\
A pythonic way to use the Finnhub data API.

This package is still in a very early stage of development, so it is still incomplete and may contain bugs. It should only be used to test its functionality.
\

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~


 .. code:: bash

   pip install fhub


Quick start
~~~~~~~~~~~

You need a Finnhub API Key, you can get free one, at https://finnhub.io.  For some data a premium account is necessary.

.. code:: python

    from fhub import Session
    hub = Session("your_finnhub_api_key_here")
    
    # Download prices time serie of Tesla.
    tsla = hub.candle('TSLA')
   
    # Download prices for several tickers from a date.
    data = hub.candle(['AMZN', 'NFLX', 'DIS'], start="2018-01-01")

    # Download prices and bollinger bands indicator for several tickers.
    data = hub.indicator(['AAPL', 'MSFT'], start='2019-01-01', indicator='bbands',
                     indicator_fields={'timeperiod': 10})


Real-time subscription via Finnhub's websocket is easy using fhub, even using custom functions for each tick received.

.. code:: python

    from fhub import Subscription
    from time import sleep

    def price_monitor(ticker):
        # Callback function receive a ticker object
        # calculate the average of the last 30 ticks using the ticker history
        average = ticker.history.price.tail(30).mean().round(2)
        # display the price and the calculated average
        print (f'{ticker.symbol}. Price: {ticker.price} Average(30) : {average}')
        # show a message if price is over its average
        if ticker.price > average:
            print(f'{ticker.symbol} is over its average price')
        return

    # Create a subscription and connect
    subs = Subscription("your_finnhub_api_key_here")
    # A list of the symbols to which to subscribe is passed
    # Created function  is assigned as a callback when a new tick is received
    subs.connect(["BINANCE:BTCUSDT", "IC MARKETS:1", "AAPL"],
                 on_tick=price_monitor
                )

    # Subscription is maintained for 20 seconds and then closed.
    for f in range(20):
        sleep(1)
    subs.close()
