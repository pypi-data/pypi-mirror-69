Description: qgispluginreleaser
        ==========================================
        
        Add-on for zest.releaser for releasing QGIS plugins.
        
        Zest.releaser can be extended, see its `entrypoints documentation
        <http://zestreleaser.readthedocs.org/en/latest/entrypoints.html>`_.
        
        What we do:
        
        - We hook into the "release" step and create a zipfile with a version number
          and copy it to the current directory. You can scp it to a server afterwards.
        
        - In the "prerelease" and "postrelease" steps we change the version number in
          the (mandatory) QGIS ``metadata.txt`` file.
        
        Note: a QGIS plugin doesn't have a ``setup.py``, so you'll need to add a
        ``version.txt`` or ``version.rst`` or ``VERSION`` file so that zest.releaser
        recognizes the current directory as a releasable project and so that it can
        find the version number somewhere. Simply put the version number ("1.2") by
        itself on the first line. A newline at the end is fine.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You'll have to install it globally (or in a custom virtualenv) as qgis plugins
        normally don't have a full python setup.
        
        The plugin checks whether there's a ``metadata.txt`` (lowercase) with a
        ``qgisMinimumVersion`` string inside it. If found, the plugin runs. Otherwise
        it stays out of the way. So it should be safe to install globally.

        Changelog of qgispluginreleaser
        ===================================================
        
        
        1.1 (2020-05-25)
        ----------------
        
        - Allow the ``metadata.txt`` to also be one subdirectory deeper.
        
        
        1.0 (2017-06-20)
        ----------------

        0.2 (2016-02-01)
        ----------------
        
        - Qgis expects zip filenames to use a dot as name/version separator instead of
          a dash. We now create the zipfile with a dot instead.

        - Creating a zipfile (with version number in the filename) automatically in

          question.
