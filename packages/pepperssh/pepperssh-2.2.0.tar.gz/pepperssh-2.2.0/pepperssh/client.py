class Client:
    """
    Creates an SSH connection to a remote host and allows Python scripts to be
    sent and executed.

    To run a script remotely, call `script(filename)`.  This will execute the
    module and return a proxy to it.  The proxy allows you to call functions in
    the script remotely:

        script = client.script('setupdb.py')
        result = script.createdb(name='test')

    Parameters sent to the proxied function and its return value are pickled,
    so many Python objects can be used.  Since all exception classes may not be
    available on the local machine, exceptions are returned as string
    tracebacks and a RuntimeError is raised.

    Anything printed to the screen by the remote function is printed on the
    screen locally.

    Bi-directional input is not supported, so remote functions must not call
    functions like getpass().

    By default, the client stops waiting for remote function calls after 2
    minutes and disconnects.  The current command will stay running (it is not
    forcefully terminated) but will exit when the command is complete.  To
    override this default, use the function proxy's `settimeout` method:

        script.createdb.timeout = 5 * 60
        script.createdb('test')
