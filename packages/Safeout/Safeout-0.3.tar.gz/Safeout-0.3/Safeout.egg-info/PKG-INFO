Description: # Safeout: write out a file safely
        
        With `safeout`, you can write:
        
            from safeout import safeout
            with safeout('output.txt') as output:
                output.write("Hello world\n")
        
        and this will write out the file `output.txt` in a safe, atomic manner. That
        is, if there are any problems (Exceptions or a crash) in the `with` block, then
        there there will be **no output**. If the `with` block completes, then the
        output file will include the whole result.
        
        So, if the output file exists, you can be confident that the process completed
        correctly.
