In this case.  the smallest possible has been assumed. Delta-T between Jacket/bath and OT sensor too large. The heating was reduced or turned off due to the difference between the over-temperature trip sensor and jacket-temperature being is too high. The heating is reduced to minimise excessively high surface temperatures on the heating element. This is a typical sign of very poor fluid circulation. The heat energy in the heater is not transferred out of the chamber to the outlet temperature sensor. Temp difference between heater and outlet is greater than 30°C. Heater turned off. Ensure flow is improved.  or thinner oil is used. Help can often be given by reducing the heating power by 50% or so. Cannot write to seven segment display.

-16442,info,Power switched on after user reset,Action
-20000,action,The superheat of the HT stage has been too small for some time, therefore the the HT-Valve should be closed. (possibly the valve closes too slowly when controlling)
-20001,action,The superheat of the MT stage has been too small for some time, therefore the the MT-Valve should be closed. (possibly the valve closes too slowly when controlling)
-20002,action,Stepper motor reset because of stepper motor minimum position while cooling control,
-20003,action,A reference run of the stepper motor expansion valve, used to control the compressor circuit which cooles the expansion and vent lines.  has been done because of a too low superheat
-20004,action,Stepper motor reset because the superheat inside the first LT stage evaporator has been too small for some time,
-20005,action,Stepper motor reset because the superheat inside the second LT stage evaporator has been too small for some time,
-20006,action,Delta-T between Jacket/bath and OT sensor too large,The heating was reduced or turned off due to the difference between the over-temperature trip sensor and jacket-temperature being is too high. The heating is reduced to minimise. excessively high surface temperatures on the heating element. This is a typical sign of very poor fluid circulation. The heat energy in the heater is not transferred out of the chamber to the outlet temperature sensor. Temp difference between heater and outlet is greater than 30°C. Heater turned off. Ensure flow is improved.  or thinner oil is used. Help can often be given by reducing the heating power by 50% or so
