Description: # TrackMe - media-monitoring app for tracking your keywords across Twitter and Telegram
        > First CS year coursework
        
        TrackMe lets you track your keywords accross two social media platforms: Twitter and Telegram. It currently only supports Ukrainian keywords, tweets, and posts, and has only Ukrainian web interface. 
        
        This project consists of two parts:
        * 2 worker proccesses that perform parsing
        * web application for displaying parsing results
        
        The statistic we display for your keywords can be seen on the screenshot below.

        ## Demo
        
        You can watch our demo video [on YouTube](https://newskitbot6.herokuapp.com/)
        
        ## Development setup
        
        Install requirements.txt using pip.
        
        You also have to download chromedriver and set the correct enviromental variables in config.py
        
        In this repository we do not include config.py, so you have to add it yourself. Here are the contents of it:
        
        ```
        import logging
        secret_key = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
        mongoclient = 'YOUR_MONGO_DB_KEY_LINK'
        mongoname = 'YOUR_MONGO_DB_NAME'
        NUMBER_WORDS = 20
        flask_key = 'YOUR_FLASK_APP_SECRET_KEY'
        BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
        
        # GOOGLE_CHROME_BIN = '/app/.apt/usr/bin/google-chrome'  # POSSIBLE CHROME PATH FOR LINUX
        # CHROMEDRIVER_PATH = '/app/.chromedriver/bin/chromedriver'  # POSSIBLE CHROMEDRIVER PATH FOR LINUX
        
        GOOGLE_CHROME_BIN = '/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome' # POSSIBLE CHROME PATH FOR MAC
        CHROMEDRIVER_PATH = '/usr/local/bin/chromedriver'  # POSSIBLE CHROMEDRIVER PATH FOR MAC
        
        logger = logging.getLogger("main_logger")  # SET UP LOGGER AND LOGGING LEVELS
        
        ```
