Module that monkey-patches json module when it's imported so
JSONEncoder.default() automatically checks for a special "to_json()"
method and uses it to encode the object if found. This is done in 
__init__ to ensure that the patch is applied before the JSONEncoder
is used. This is mainly to work with the custom date types when
being serialized into json.
