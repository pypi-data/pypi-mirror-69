Python class for verifying Yubico One Time Passwords (OTPs) based on the
validation protocol version 2.0.

* Yubico website: http://www.yubico.com
* Yubico documentation: http://www.yubico.com/developers/intro/
* Validation Protocol Version 2.0 description: https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-val/Validation_Protocol_V2.0.html

For more information and usage examples, please see the.
`documentation <https://yubico-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation is available at https://yubico-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install yubico-client

Note: Package has been recently renamed from `yubico` to `yubico-client` and
the main module has been renamed from `yubico` to `yubico_client`. This
was done to avoid naming conflicts and make creation of distribution specific
packages easier.

Changelog
=========

1.13.0 - 2020-05-21
-------------------

* Update client to query a single API server instead of multiple ones in
  parallel by default.

  Previously, we queried 6 Yubico API servers in parallel for high availability
  and performance reasons.

  Now api.yubico.com is globally distributed and load balanced so there is no
  need for us to do that anymore and we can just query a single API server and
  let the server handle HA and load-balancing.

  Users who run their own internal Yubikey validation servers can still specify
  a list of servers by passing ``api_urls`` argument to the client constructor
  (same as before).

  Contributed by @mallensb and @nrw505. Part of #31 and #32.

1.12.0 - 2019-11-18
-------------------

* Update code to retry HTTP requests for server errors which might work on a
  retry (5xx status codes returned by the server). Those errors could simply
  indicate a gateway or a proxy error which might work on a retry.

  Contributed by Nigel Williams (@nrw505) #30
* Pin minimum version for ``requests`` dependency to ``v2.22.0``.
* Update the code so we don't throw an exception if one of the multiple servers
  we query has issues.

  We query multiple servers in parallel purely for availability reasons and the
  consistency / sync part is taken care by the server side. The client returns
  immediately as soon as it receives one positive or a negative response.

  Contributed by Nigel Williams (@nrw505) #29
* Update code so we send ``User-Agent`` header which includes client version
  information and platform string with each HTTP request.
* Also test the code with Python 3.8.0 and indicate we also support Python 3.8.

1.11.0 - 2019-07-06
-------------------

* Drop support for Python 2.6. #28
* Test the code and verify it works with the following Python versions:
  * Python 3.3
  * Python 3.4
  * Python 3.5
  * Python 3.6
  * Python 3.7
  * PyPy 2
  * PyPy 3 #28

1.10.0 - 2015-10-02
-------------------

* Fix compatibility issue with Python versions >= 3.0 <= 3.3 #22
* Pin ``requests`` dependency to the latest version (2.7) #25 #27

  Contribution by Wouter van Bommel, Vianney Carel.

* Make sure the query parameters are unquoted when parsing them from the
  response. #23

  Contribution by Tamás Gulácsi.

1.9.1 - 2014-02-05
------------------

* Fix Python 3 compatibility issue. #21

1.9.0 - 2014-01-16
------------------

* To discourage bad practices, remove ``use_https`` argument from the `Yubico`
  class constructor all together. Also update ``DEFAULT_API_URLS`` variable to
  contain full URLs with a scheme (e.g.
  ``https://api.yubico.com/wsapi/2.0/verify``).

  If a user wants to use a custom non-https URL or URLs, they can still do that
  by passing ``api_urls`` argument with custom non-https URLs to the
  constructor.

* Replace ``CA_CERTS_BUNDLE_PATH`` module level variable with a
  ``ca_certs_bundle_path`` argument which can be passed to the Yubico class
  constructor.

* Update ``requests`` dependency from ``1.2`` to ``2.2``.

1.8.0 - 2013-11-09
------------------

* Modify ``verify_multi`` method to throw if ``otp_list`` argument contains
  less than two items
* Modify ``max_time_window`` argument in the ``verify_multi`` method to be
  in seconds (#19)
* Modify ``verify_multi`` method to throw if delta between the first and last
  OTP timestamp is smaller than zero

* Allow user to pass ``api_urls`` argument to the ``Yubico`` class constructor.
  This argument can contain a list of API urls which are used to validate the
  token. https://github.com/Kami/python-yubico-client/pull/18

  Contributed by Dain Nilsson
* Depend on newer version (``1.2.3``) of the ``requests`` library.
* Update code and tests so they also work under Python 3.3

1.7.0 - 2013-04-06
------------------

* Change PyPi package name from ``yubico`` to ``yubico-client``.

  This was done to prevent naming collisions and make creation of distribution
  specific packages (e.g. debian packages) easier.

1.6.2 - 2013-04-02
------------------

* If there are multiple interpretations for a given OTP, first try to find the one
  which matches the input OTP. If the one is found, use the input OTP, otherwise
  use random interpretation. - https://github.com/Kami/python-yubico-client/issues/14

  Reported by Klas Lindfors

1.6.1 - 2013-03-19
------------------

* Only run ``logging.basicConfig`` when running tests so logging config isn't initialised
  on module import - https://github.com/Kami/python-yubico-client/pull/13

1.6.0 - 2013-01-24
------------------

* Allow user to specify a path to the CA bundle which is used for verifying the
  server SSL certificate by setting ``CA_CERTS_BUNDLE_PATH`` variable.
* When selecting which CA bundle is used for verifying the server SSL
  certificate look for the bundle in some common locations - https://github.com/Kami/python-yubico-client/pull/10
* Drop support for Python 2.5
* Use ``requests`` library for performing HTTP requests and turn SSL cert
  verification on by default
* Avoid busy-looping (add ``time.sleep``) when waiting for responses - https://github.com/Kami/python-yubico-client/pull/9
* Allow user to pass in value ``0`` for ``sl`` argument in ``verify`` and
  ``verify_multi`` method - https://github.com/Kami/python-yubico-client/pull/8
* Throw an exception inside ``verify`` and ``verify_multi`` method if timeout has
  occurred or invalid status code is returned - https://github.com/Kami/python-yubico-client/pull/7
* Improve response validation and of included, verify that ``otp`` and ``nonce``
  parameters in the response match one provided in the request - https://github.com/Kami/python-yubico-client/pull/7
* Add logging
