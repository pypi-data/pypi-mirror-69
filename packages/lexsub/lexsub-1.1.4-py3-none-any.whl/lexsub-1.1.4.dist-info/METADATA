## Setup 
``` 
pip3 install lexsub
Release: https://pypi.org/project/lexsub/   
```

## Background
The Lexical Substitution task involves selecting and ranking lexical paraphrases for a target word in a given sentential context. In the task, annotators and systems find an alternative substitute word or phrase for a target word in context.
The task involves both finding the synonyms and disambiguating the context.
To give an example:
```
Context: The wine was too strong to drink.
Target Word: strong

Predicted Candidates (Ranked): 
powerful 
potent 
warm
hot 
solid 
hard 
```

*Powerful* and *potent* are much better replacements as indicated by 
the score next to them as well. Whereas, all are viable 
replacement candidates given the context from a language modeling
perspective.   
Now notice two important things that is interesting: 
* Not all synonyms fit in the context.  
(direct lexical substitutions aka synonyms won’t always work)
* Not all words that fit in the context preserve the meaning 
of the sentence. (LM score doesn’t always correlate)
