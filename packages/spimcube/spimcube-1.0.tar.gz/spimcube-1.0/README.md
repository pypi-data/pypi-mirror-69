# Spimcube
GUI to explore Datacube of spectra and additionnal handy functions.

For the moment, the tools to explore the datacube are specifically designed for datacubes consisting of a spatial grid where each pixel of the grid contains a spectrum (in nm or eV).

This repository also contained a bunch of functions I believe can come in handy to others.
