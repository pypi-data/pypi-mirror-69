Introduction
------------
Scenario-optimiser maximises results given scenarios as an input. It uses either linear
programming or a gradient method to the optimisation. It finds an optimal allocation of
a constraint metric, to maximise a goal value given an overall constraint value
(=sum of constraint metric values).

Input should be a data frame with expected revenues per media channel at different
cost levels.

Examples
--------
Optimise cost per media channel in order to maximise revenues given a budget.

The directory examples includes code snippets.
