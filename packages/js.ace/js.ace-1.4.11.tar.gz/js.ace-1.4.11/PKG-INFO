        Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `Ajax.org Cloud9 Editor`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`Ajax.org Cloud9 Editor`: https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.ace``) are published to some URL.

        How to use?

        these resources to be included on a page::
