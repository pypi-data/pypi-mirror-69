Introduction
============

This library packages `Ajax.org Cloud9 Editor`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`Ajax.org Cloud9 Editor`: https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.ace``) are published to some URL.
