xapian-bindings
===============

**NOTE: This package is not guaranteed to fully functional! Use at your own risk!**

xapian-bindings is a meta-package to simplify installation of the `xapian-bindings <https://xapian.org/download>`_ extension
for Python. It determines the version of ``xapian-bindings`` to use based on the version of `xapian-core <https://xapian.org/download>`_ installed;
downloads and extracts the source code; then runs ``./configure``, ``make`` and ``make install``.

This project is not affiliated with the `Xapian <https://xapian.org/>`_ project in any way.

Installation
------------

1. Ensure you have essential build & development tools installed on your system.
2. Ensure you have ``xapian-core`` installed via your system package manager or source tarball.
3. Run ``pip install --no-cache-dir xapian-bindings``.
4. Verify installation by running ``python -c "import xapian; print(xapian.__version__)"``.
