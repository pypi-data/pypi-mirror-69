Description: # ProtobufMessageFactory
        This module tries to ease up the work with protobuf messages 
        in python by allowing to automatically import and compile 
        .proto files and access the messages by their name.
        ## Requirements
        Protoc needs to be available on your system.
        You can check this by executing:
        ```
        protoc --version
        ```
        If it is not installed download it here:
        ```

        ```
        After the download you have to put the executable into your PATH.
