========================== || devGossip ||================================
[About:] devGossip is a commandline forum app for interaction between developers from around the world. It is a safe space for developers to talk about anything and everything.

[Design:] The app is built using python. Users can signup, login and join various discussion rooms. They also have an option to delete their user. The messages in the forum are relayed using the pusher module to trigger a connection to the pusher server where the app is hosted. The termcolor module was used to give the app some color and a virtual enviroment was used for development.

NB: Termcolor module was used, which may only work on non-windows operating systems

[How to deploy:] Open the command and run
pip install devgossip-v2. After installation run 'devgossip-v2' to use the program

Enjoy!!
