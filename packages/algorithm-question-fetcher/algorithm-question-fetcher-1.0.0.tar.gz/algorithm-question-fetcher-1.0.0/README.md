This is a console platform that fetches algorithm questions. It does so by making use of the request library in python and also the BeautifulSoup library.

What the request library is used for is that it is used to get the url of the website where the algorithm questions are being fetched. The BeautifulSoup library is used to scrape the algorithm questions off the website which is then saved in a list.

The user is able to enter the number of questions he or she wants to get out of the algorithm questions saved in the list, if the user does not enter an number, the script returns one question by default.

#Usage
run "pip install" command on the terminal to install the app

You will have to sign up and then login after to be able to fetch the questions. After the questions have been fetched an option for you to ask another question or close the app is presented, if you choose to close the app, the app closes immediately.

Please note that entering the wrong input when the app asks for an input closes the app immediately, endeavour to enter the correct input at all times.
