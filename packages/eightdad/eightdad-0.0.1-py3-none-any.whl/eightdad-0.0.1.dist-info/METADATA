# EightDAD

## Overview

### What
For now, it's only a [Chip-8 Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) in python.

The name comes from the tools I hope to add: 
* **Eight**, as in Chip-8 VM
* **D**ebugger
* **A**ssembler
* **D**isassembler

### Why

I want to learn more about assemblers, Virtual Machines, and implementing
languages! This is a step toward other projects and becoming a better
developer.

#### But [Octo](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo) already exists!

I know. I like it, but it's not helping me reach the goals I outlined above.

I'm also hoping to write simple 
[demos](http://demoscene-the-art-of-coding.net/the-demoscene/) that push the
limits of what's been built for Chip-8. I think implementing a Chip-8 
interpreter will prepare me for that.
