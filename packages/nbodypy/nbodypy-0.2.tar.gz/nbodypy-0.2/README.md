## Purpose

_We are in development, and this is the beginning of the project! It is a beta version of the module._

The package provides tools for studying the N-body problem. It
provides a sub package concerning the Restricted Circular Three Body
Problem, with the computation of periodic orbit around Libration
points and associated invariant manifolds.



## Installation

### `pip`

### `PYTHONPATH`

`PYTHONPATH` sets the search path for importing python modules. So, a
reasonable way to use `nbodypy` is to install it using the `PYTHONPATH`
mechanism.

Suppose that we have a directory in which we want to put all the local
python package or modules: `/home/LOGIN/the/path`.

You can export this directory to the environment variable `PYTHONPATH`
(in your `.bashrc` for example) :

    export PYTHONPATH=/home/LOGIN/the/path:$PYTHONPATH

### Add the `nbodypy` directory

After doing that, you just have to add the `nbodypy` directory of the
git repository (containing the python files) in the python directory:

    /home/LOGIN/the/path/nbodypy
