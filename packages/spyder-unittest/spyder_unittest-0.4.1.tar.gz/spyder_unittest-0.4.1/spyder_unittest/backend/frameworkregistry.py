class FrameworkRegistry():
    """
    Registry of testing frameworks and their associated runners.

    The test runner for a framework is responsible for running the tests and
    parsing the results. It should implement the interface of RunnerBase.

    Frameworks should first be registered using `.register()`. This registry
    can then create the assoicated test runner when `.create_runner()` is
    called.

    Attributes
    ----------
    frameworks : dict of (str, type)
        Dictionary mapping names of testing frameworks to the types of the
        associated runners.

        Parameters
        ----------
        runner_class : type
            Class used for creating tests runners for the framework.

        Parameters
        ----------
        framework : str
            Name of testing framework.
        widget : UnitTestWidget
            Unit test widget which constructs the test runner.
        resultfilename : str or None
            Name of file in which to store test results. If None, use default.

        Returns
        -------
        RunnerBase
            Newly created test runner

        Exceptions
        ----------
        KeyError
            Provided testing framework has not been registered.
